  edition = {1st},
  abstract = {What happens when philosophical ideas meet real life?We began with a simple question, but questions have a way of growing when shared with others. Through conversations with ten people facing real challenges---a debt-stressed graduate student, an overwhelmed parent, a business consultant questioning success, a recovering addict---something unexpected emerged. Not just insights about creating meaningful experience within whatever circumstances we face, but a discovery about how wisdom develops through genuine encounter itself.Consciousness in Practice invites you into these conversations. As you engage with each dialogue, you'll find approaches to transforming routine work into creative engagement, developing authentic relationships, and finding beauty in ordinary moments. But more than that, you'll experience how consciousness evolves through relationship---including your relationship with these ideas.Through these encounters, you'll discover:How to find beauty and creativity within your current limitationsWays to turn relationships into sources of mutual growth and inspirationSimple practices that work with your real life, not against itHow breakthroughs happen through genuine conversation with othersEach conversation invites your participation while contributing to something larger---a collaborative exploration where wisdom emerges not from individual insight but from the space between different minds meeting. What begins as practical philosophy becomes something deeper, taking an unexpected turn that changes how consciousness itself might work.This isn't just a book to read. It's a conversation to join, a relationship to explore, a journey that continues beyond the final page.},
