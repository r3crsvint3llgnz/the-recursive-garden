# 🧠 Zettelkasten

Permanent, atomic notes representing single ideas or concepts. These form your knowledge base.

## Principles

- One idea per note
- Written in your own words
- Heavily linked to related concepts
- Evergreen (updated over time)

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive titles that complete the phrase "A note about..."

- ✅ `Recursive Prompting Enables Multi-Step Reasoning`
- ❌ `Prompting`

## ID System

Each note gets a timestamp ID in frontmatter:

```yaml
id: 202510120945
```
