# Eisenhower Matrix Interpreter

> [!info]+ Prompt — quick copy
---

Here's my entire to-do list: {{PASTE_LIST}}.
Categorize each item into Eisenhower Matrix: Urgent-Important, Important-Not Urgent, Urgent-Not Important, Neither.
Then output four sections:
- Do today (top 3, justify briefly)
- Schedule this week (with suggested day/time windows)
- Delegate/automate (with suggested assignee/tool)
- Delete entirely (be ruthless; 1-line rationale each)
Format as a table with columns: Item | Quadrant | Action | Rationale.
