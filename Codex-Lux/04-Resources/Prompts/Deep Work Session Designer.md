# Deep Work Session Designer

> [!info]+ Prompt — quick copy
---

I have {{X hours}} for deep work on {{PROJECT}} today.
Design a session plan with:
- Pre-work setup (5 min checklist)
- Main focus blocks (each with a concrete output/outcome)
- Strategic break timing (durations and activities)
- Stuck-point protocol (what to do if blocked)
- Shutdown ritual (wrap + next-step capture)
 Format as: Block | Duration | Objective | Steps | Break | Exit criteria.
 Optimize for cognitive endurance.
