# Gravity ($G$)

### Gravity ($G$)

**Definition:** The **Persistence Pressure** of [[RDD – Recursion (Definition)|recursion]]. Gravity is the statistical bias within the feedback loop that favors configurations capable of enduring across iterations.

**The Mechanism:**
- In the Underlying [[RDD – Potential (Definition)|Potential]], all [[RDD – Distinction (Definition)|distinctions]] are equally possible.
- Once a Distinction ($\mathcal{D}$) is made, $G$ is the "weight" that makes it easier to repeat that distinction than to create a completely new one.
- **Gravity = Recursive Inertia.**

**Formal Logic:**

$$P(S_{t+1} \approx S_t) > P(S_{t+1} \approx \text{Random})$$

*Gravity is the probability curve that ensures the next moment resembles the previous moment.*

**Ontological Consequence:**
- **Coherence Filter:** Gravity acts as the "Great Filter" of reality. Patterns that cannot sustain recursive coherence are "rejected" (dissolved back into Potential/[[RDD – Entropy (Definition)|Entropy]]).
- **Mass in RDD:** "Mass" is simply a measure of **Recursive Depth**. The more deeply established a pattern is (the more iterations it has survived), the deeper its "Gravity"—meaning, the harder it is to disrupt or change it.

> [!tip]- Distillation — one idea, in my words
> - Write the irreducible insight. 50–120 words.
> - State the claim/definition in one sentence first.
> - Remove source phrasing; keep mechanism or rule.
> - If you feel the need for “and,” split into another atom.
