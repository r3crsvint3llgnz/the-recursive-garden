# **Underlying Potential ($\Omega$)**

- **Definition:** The pre-[[RDD – Distinction (Definition)|distinction]] field. A superposition field of mutually exclusive possibilities. It is not "void" or "nothingness," but the infinite capacity for form (Information Capacity $\to \infty$).
    
- **Contextual Anchor:** Similar to the **Quantum Wave Function** ($\Psi$) before collapse, or the **Bohmian Implicate Order**.

> [!tip]- Distillation — one idea, in my words
> - Write the irreducible insight. 50–120 words.
> - State the claim/definition in one sentence first.
> - Remove source phrasing; keep mechanism or rule.
> - If you feel the need for “and,” split into another atom.
