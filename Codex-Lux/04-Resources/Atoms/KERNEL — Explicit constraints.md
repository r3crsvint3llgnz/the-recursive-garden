State what the model must not do and the hard bounds it must respect. Negative directives and caps (libraries, line limits, runtime, style bans) prune the search space and suppress unwanted behavior.

- Reduces hallucinated extras.
- Improves determinism and safety.
- Lowers edit cost by preventing overreach.
