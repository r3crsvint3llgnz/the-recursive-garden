# **Persistence ($\Pi$)**

- **Definition:** The measure of a [[RDD – Distinction (Definition)|distinction's]] structural stability across recursive updates. It is the effective resistance to [[RDD – Entropy (Definition)|entropy]].

- **Formalism:** $\Pi(\mathcal{D}) \iff R(\mathcal{D}_t) \approx \mathcal{D}_{t+1}$. Persistence is achieved when the output of recursion is structurally isomorphic to the input.

- **Contextual Anchor:** **Heinz von Foerster’s Eigenvalues** (Objects as tokens for eigenbehaviors); **Identity Theory** (Continuity of pattern vs. substance).

- Persistence is the "survival rate" of a distinction.
- In a system of constant [[RDD – Recursion (Definition)|recursion]], nothing is static; things only appear solid because they actively rebuild themselves in the same shape every moment.
- It is the result of [[RDD – Gravity (Definition)|Gravity]]: when a distinction falls into a stable loop (eigenbehavior), it resists dissolution and becomes an "object" rather than an "event."

- **Defines Reality:** Distinguishes "Noise" (fleeting, unstable cuts) from "Signal" (stable, enduring matter).
- **Explains Identity:** Clarifies that "You" are a persistent pattern of information, not the specific biological atoms currently hosting that pattern.
- **Predicts Decay:** Implies that persistence requires energy; without active recursive maintenance,  drops to 0 and the object dissolves.
