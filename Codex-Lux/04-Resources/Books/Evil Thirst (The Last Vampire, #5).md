# Evil Thirst (The Last Vampire, #5)

## Summary

Alisa's daughter, Kalika, has transformed into a blood-thirsty monster with power far beyond Alisa's. It is Alisa's task to track her down and destroy her, yet Alisa still has trouble believing her daughter is totally evil. She still hopes to save Kalika, even if it means risking her own life--and perhaps the lives of everyone in the world.
