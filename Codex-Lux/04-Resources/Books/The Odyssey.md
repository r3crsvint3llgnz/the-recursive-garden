# The Odyssey

## Summary

When Robert Fagles' translation of the Iliad was published in 199, critics and scholars alike hailed it as a masterpiece. Now one of the great translators of our time presents us with the Odyssey, Homer's best-loved poem, recounting Odysseus' wanderings after the Trojan War. With wit and wile, the 'man of twists and turns' meets the challenges of gods and monsters, only to return after twenty years to a home besieged by his wife's suitors. In the myths and legends retold in this immortal poem, Fagles has captured the energy of Homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom.
