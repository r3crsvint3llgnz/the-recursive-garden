# Black Order (Sigma Force, #3)

## Summary

In Copenhagen, a suspicious bookstore fire propels Commander Gray Pierce of SIGMA Force on a relentless hunt across four continents. Meanwhile, a terrifying mystery surrounding horrific experiments performed in an abandoned laboratory unfolds in Poland, and Buddhist monks in the mountains of Nepal inexplicably turn to cannibalism and torture. They seem to suffer from a baffling, mind-destroying malady, whose signs are beginning to appear in Painter Crowe, director of SIGMA Force. Now, only SIGMA Force can save a world suddenly in terrible jeopardy, because a new order—one that may answer questions about the origin of life—is on the rise. Don't miss an exclusive excerpt from the next SIGMA Force adventure The Devil Colony (available June 21), in which gruesome murders in an Indian cave lead Painter Crowe to a dark cabal that has been manipulating history since the founding of America.
