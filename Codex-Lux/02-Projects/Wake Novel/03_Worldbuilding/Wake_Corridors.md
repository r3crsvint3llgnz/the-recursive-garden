# Wake Corridors - FTL Travel System
## 40-Chapter Plot Module Integration

*This file details the wake corridor system and how it functions within the 40-Chapter Plot Module structure to provide both enabling technology and plot-driving obstacles.*

### Module Function
- **Act I (Scenes 0-11)**: Wake corridors as ordinary world transportation enabling the journey
- **Act II (Scenes 12-30)**: Corridor instability as external pressure forcing character development
- **Act III (Scenes 31-40)**: Corridor mastery representing character growth and new capabilities

### Story Integration Points
- **Scene 4 (Into Corridor)**: Entry represents crossing threshold into special world
- **Scene 16 (Bomb/Ordeal)**: Corridor destabilization as supreme ordeal
- **Scene 18 (Crash)**: Forced exit as symbolic death/rebirth moment
- **Scene 39 (Departure)**: Successful navigation as mastery demonstration

## Basic Physics

### Core Concept
Wake corridors are naturally occurring spacetime distortions that allow faster-than-light travel by "riding" the gravitational wake of massive objects moving through higher-dimensional space.

### Discovery
- **2130s**: First detected by miniaturized LIGO-like gravitational wave detectors
- **Initial Detection**: Massive alien vessels traveling at near-light speed through the solar system
- **Research Phase**: 2130s-2140s - ASI analysis of gravitational wake patterns
- **First Navigation**: 2160s - Human ships successfully follow alien vessel wakes for interstellar travel

## How Wake Corridors Work

### Formation
- Created by the passage of massive objects (black holes, neutron stars) through higher dimensions
- Leave "trails" in normal spacetime that can be detected and followed
- Corridors exist for varying lengths of time (hours to centuries)

### Navigation Requirements
- Specialized sensors to detect corridor boundaries
- Precise entry velocity and angle
- Constant course corrections during transit
- Advanced AI systems for real-time calculations

### Travel Mechanics
- Ships enter corridor at specific entry points
- Time flows differently inside corridors
- Space is compressed, allowing FTL travel
- Exit points are predetermined but not always predictable

## Types of Corridors

### Stable Corridors
- **Duration**: Years to decades
- **Predictability**: High
- **Safety**: Relatively safe with proper equipment
- **Usage**: Major trade routes, regular transport

### Unstable Corridors
- **Duration**: Days to months
- **Predictability**: Moderate
- **Safety**: Dangerous, requires expert navigation
- **Usage**: Exploration, emergency travel

### Quantum Corridors
- **Duration**: Hours to days
- **Predictability**: Low
- **Safety**: Extremely dangerous
- **Usage**: Last resort, experimental research

## Navigation Challenges

### Entry Difficulties
- Precise timing required
- Gravitational interference
- Corridor boundaries can shift unexpectedly
- Entry failure can destroy ships

### Transit Hazards
- Temporal distortions affecting crew
- Gravitational shearing forces
- Corridor collapse during transit
