This is the central hub for all key story elements and files, organized around the 40-Chapter Plot Module framework.

### 40-Chapter Module Overview

**Wake Novel Structure**: 25 chapters covering 40 module scenes  
**Integration Method**: Each chapter encompasses 1-2 module scenes  
**Character Arcs**: All major characters mapped to module progression  
**Collaborative Process**: Human creativity guided by module structure

### Module Act Structure
- **Act I (Scenes 0-11)**: Setup, call to adventure, new world entry [Chapters 1-7]
- **Act II (Scenes 12-30)**: Tests, ordeals, midpoint revelations [Chapters 8-17]  
- **Act III (Scenes 31-40)**: Climax, resolution, return transformed [Chapters 18-25]

## Core Premise

**Wake: Book One**  
*Hard Sci-Fi / Psychological Horror / Exploration / Post-Scarcity Space Opera*

A relativistic wake-rider trade vessel is diverted to investigate a newly detected interstellar corridor. Carrying scientists, a jaded captain, and religious pilgrims, the ship is sabotaged mid-slipstream and crash-lands on a rogue world filled with nightmarish evolutionary horrors. As tensions rise, secrets are revealed, and a merger between human and alien AI changes everything.

**40-Chapter Integration**: Classic hero's journey structure with ensemble cast, survival horror middle act, and transcendent resolution.

### Faction Motivations
*   **The Captain (Nyra Vesta):** Publicly, she's a jaded but competent professional. Privately, she's on a desperate, decades-long search for her parents, who vanished on a similar route. Each "wake" is a potential clue, making this mission both a job and a painful, personal obsession.
*   **The Scientists:** In a post-scarcity world, they seek the ultimate currency: legacy. This mission to an unknown corridor is a chance for unprecedented discovery, to write their names in the annals of human exploration and push the known boundaries of science.
*   **The Pilgrims:** They are religious zealots fleeing a technologically-saturated Earth they see as soulless. They view the unknowable wake-riders as divine "angels" and believe this journey is a sacred pilgrimage to find God, ironically using the very technology they condemn to do so.

## Story Timeline & Setting

**Story Date**: Mid-2200s (approximately 2250-2260 CE)

### Historical Timeline
- **2040s-2070s**: AGI achievement leads to energy abundance and Full Automation of Labor (FAoL)
- **2100s-2130s**: ASI emergence enables solar system expansion and advanced gravitational wave detection
- **2140s-2160s**: Development of wake-following ships and first interstellar exploration
- **2170s-2200s**: Human settlement of multiple solar systems (Alpha Centauri, Proxima Centauri, 82 Eridani)
- **2250s**: Story setting - mature interstellar civilization with established trade routes and wake corridor networks

### Technological Foundation
- **Miniaturized LIGO Technology**: Advanced gravitational wave detectors capable of sensing near-light-speed vessels
- **Wake Corridor Navigation**: ASI-calculated insertion vectors allow ships to follow gravitational wakes of alien vessels
- **Post-Scarcity Society**: Energy abundance through fusion and automated production reduces material costs to near-zero
- **Extended Human Lifespan**: Medical advances enable lifespans of 200-300+ years, with relativistic time effects for frequent travelers

- **Last Updated**: July 5, 2025

## Key Plot Arc - Module Aligned
1. **Act I Setup (Scenes 0-11)**: Mission acceptance → Cultural conflicts → Murder/paranoia
2. **Act II Ordeal (Scenes 12-30)**: Crash survival → Planet exploration → AI merger revelation  
3. **Act III Resolution (Scenes 31-40)**: Agent unmasked → Final battles → Transformed return
4. **Crisis**: Murder discovered, explosion, corridor destabilization
5. **Survival Horror**: Crash landing, stalked by feral humans
6. **Revelation**: AI merger reveals galaxy-wide seeded worlds
7. **Cliffhanger**: Map of imperial human civilization exposed

## Notes

**Next Steps**:
- Populate character files with detailed cast from notes
- Expand worldbuilding with wake corridor mechanics
- Create chapter outlines for three-act structure
- Develop timeline with relativistic considerations
