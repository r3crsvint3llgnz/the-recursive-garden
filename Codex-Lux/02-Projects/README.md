# 🚀 Projects

Active projects with defined goals and timelines. Each project should have clear outcomes and completion criteria.

## Project Criteria

- Has a specific goal or deliverable
- Time-bound (has an end date)
- Requires multiple steps
- Links to Areas for ongoing support

## Folder Structure

Each project gets its own subfolder with:

- Project note (from template)
- Supporting documents
- Meeting notes
- Research materials

## Linked to ~/Projects

Many projects here mirror code repositories in `~/Projects`. Keep them synced using git agents.
