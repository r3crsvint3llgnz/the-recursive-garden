- [ ] Set up [[Exercise Plan]] as project 📅 2025-11-28

- 11:34 PM: Time: 7 days/week target, but only 3 strength mornings mandatory (Mon-Wed-Fri). Optional light movement Tue-Thu-Sat-Sun.
Duration: 15–20 minutes total.
Environment: Use the home gym, minimal setup time, no music, no screens. Start the session immediately after coffee or shower to fix the trigger.

Strength Mornings (Mon-Wed-Fri)

Each begins with the same 3-minute warm-up:
1 minute brisk elliptical or jog in place → 30 seconds arm circles → 30 seconds bodyweight squats → 1 minute dynamic leg swings and torso twists.
Purpose: raise core temperature and cue movement patterning.

Then, do the following three-part circuit. One round takes about 5 minutes. Perform two rounds total. Rest 1 minute between rounds.
	1.	Squat to press (dumbbells, moderate weight)
Stand tall, dumbbells at shoulders. Squat to chair depth, then stand and push weights overhead in one smooth motion. Ten reps.
Why: trains legs and shoulders together, maintains fast-twitch recruitment through full range of motion.
	2.	Bent-over row (barbell or dumbbells)
Hinge at hips, flat back, pull weight to lower ribs, control the lowering. Eight reps.
Why: stabilizes posterior chain, offsets sedentary posture.
	3.	Split stance lunge (bodyweight or light dumbbells)
Step one foot forward, lower knee toward floor, rise again—five per leg.
Why: builds unilateral balance and hip stability.
	4.	Push-up or bench press
Perform eight controlled reps. If too easy, elevate feet or slow the descent.
Why: maintains pressing strength without fatiguing arms.
	5.	Core finisher: plank with alternating leg lift
Hold 30 seconds. Lift each leg twice during the hold.
Why: re-engages trunk stabilizers after compound lifts.

Finish with 2 minutes gentle walking to bring heart rate down. Entire session ≈ 18 minutes.
Record whether you completed both rounds, and any changes in weights. The log is part of habit formation—the visible proof loop.

⸻

Light Movement Days (Tue-Thu-Sat-Sun)

Fifteen minutes outdoors immediately after waking. Choices:
	•	Walk the nature trail briskly.
	•	Ride the bike at conversational effort.
	•	If rain: 10 minutes elliptical + 5 minutes mobility work (hip circles, shoulder rolls, forward folds).

Purpose: reinforce the morning-movement cue even when not strength training. Keep intensity low enough to finish refreshed.

⸻

Behavior mechanics
	•	Trigger: same cue daily (alarm → bathroom → drink water → start warm-up). No variation.
	•	Threshold: session short enough you never debate doing it.
	•	Tracking: mark completion on a visible calendar, not metrics. Consistency is the metric.
	•	Escalation rule: after 4 weeks with ≥ 80 % adherence, extend each strength morning by one extra circuit (≈ 10 min) or add slight load. [[quick-capture]]
