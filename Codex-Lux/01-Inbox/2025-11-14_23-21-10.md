- 11:21 PM: how to make your first $10k with ai agents without cs degree and being a mediocre developer

people make $10k in revenue building custom ai agents for small businesses. i personally had gotten 32k a month before. it's not passive income or some get-rich-quick thing, but it's real money for real work. here's things to do that i've seen online and also personally do.

**context so you know if this applies:**

* i'm a mediocre developer (know python, some js)
* no formal cs degree, learned from youtube and chatgpt
* started with $0 and no clients
* built everything with openai api, claude api, and no-code tools
* this is service business, not saas

**what actually made money:**

* custom chatbots for local businesses ($500-1,500 per project)
* workflow automation using ai ($800-2,000 per project)
* "ai employees" that handle repetitive tasks ($1,000-3,000 one-time + $200-500/month)
* teaching small business owners how to use chatgpt properly ($150-300 per session)

**how i found the first 3 clients (this was the hardest part):**

* posted in local facebook groups offering free ai audit
* dm'd 50 small business owners on linkedin saying "noticed you're still manually doing \[x\], can automate that"
* went to chamber of commerce meetup and talked to everyone
* first client was my dentist (built intake form bot)
* second was friend's dad's hvac company (automated appointment scheduling)
* third was random restaurant owner from facebook (menu qa bot for staff)

**the services that actually sold:**

*customer service chatbots ($500-1,500):*

* businesses get 100+ of the same questions
* built them a chatbot using openai api + their faq docs
* integrated with their website
* takes me 4-8 hours, charge $800-1,200

*appointment/booking automation ($800-1,500):*

* connect their calendar, phone system, crm
* ai handles scheduling, reminders, rescheduling
* uses [make.com](http://make.com) or zapier + ai to understand natural language
* takes me 6-12 hours, charge $1,000-1,500

*data entry/processing ($1,000-2,000):*

* businesses drowning in emails, forms, invoices
* built ai that reads, categorizes, enters into their system
* this saves them 10-15 hours per week
* takes me 8-15 hours to build, charge $1,500-2,000

*email/social media response automation ($800-1,200):*

* ai drafts responses to common customer emails
* human reviews before sending (important)
* also works for social media comments
* takes me 5-8 hours, charge $800-1,200

**tools i actually use (total cost \~$100/month):**

* openai api ($20-50/month depending on usage)
* anthropic api for claude ($10-30/month)
* [make.com](http://make.com) for automation workflows ($29/month)
* [bubble.io](http://bubble.io) for quick frontends (free tier works)
* airtable for databases (free tier)
* cursor for coding (optional, makes me 3x faster)

**my tech stack for beginners:**

* learn: python basics, api calls, prompt engineering
* use: openai api + langchain for the ai part
* use: [make.com](http://make.com) or zapier for connecting everything
* use: bubble or carrd for simple interfaces
* templates: steal from github, modify for client needs

**how i priced (this took trial and error):**

* started charging $300 per project (too low)
* raised to $800 after project 3
* now charge $1,000-2,000 depending on complexity
* add $200-500/month maintenance if they want it
* avoid hourly rates, do fixed project pricing

**the actual sales process:**

* dm/email 20 businesses per week
* "i noticed you're manually \[doing thing\], i can automate that with ai"
* offer free 15 min audit call
* on call: find their biggest time sink
* show them how ai could fix it (do this live, not slides)
* send proposal same day with price and timeline
* close rate is about 20% (1 in 5 calls)

**proposals that actually close:**

* one page maximum
* problem they have (in their words)
* solution (simple english, no jargon)
* what they get (specific deliverables)
* price (fixed, not hourly)
* timeline (be realistic, add 25% buffer)
* payment terms (50% upfront, 50% on delivery)

**clients who actually pay:**

* local service businesses (dentists, lawyers, hvac, etc)
* small e-commerce stores drowning in customer service
* real estate agents with too many leads
* restaurants with catering/event inquiries
* anyone doing repetitive admin work

**clients to avoid:**

* startups who want equity instead of paying
* people who say "i have an idea, you build it and we split 50/50"
* anyone asking for free work "for exposure"
* businesses that don't understand what ai can/can't do
* cheap clients who want $100 custom solutions

**realistic expectations:**

* first project takes 40 hours because you're learning
* by project 5 you're down to 8-12 hours
* finding clients is harder than building
* you'll mess up the first few projects (charge less, learn fast)
* maintenance revenue compounds over time
* this is not passive income, it's real work

**mistakes i made:**

* undercharging first 3 projects (lost $2k in potential revenue)
* building before getting deposit (got ghosted twice)
* not setting clear scope (project creep kills profit)
* saying yes to bad clients (nightmare experiences)
* trying to build saas instead of services (wasted 2 months)

**what actually works:**

* start with services, not saas (money now vs maybe later)
* local businesses need this and have budgets
* focus on saving them time, not "cool ai stuff"
* deliver fast (1-2 weeks max)
* underpromise, overdeliver
* ask for referrals after every project

**how to actually start this week:**

*day 1-3: learn the basics*

* watch 5 youtube videos on openai api
* build a simple chatbot following tutorial
* break it, fix it, understand how it works

*day 4-7: build your first demo*

* pick one use case (customer service bot)
* build a working version
* deploy it somewhere you can show people

*week 2: find your first client*

* list 50 local businesses who could use this
* dm them all with specific problem you can solve
* get on 5 calls
* land 1 client

*week 3-4: deliver and learn*

* build their solution
* fuck up parts of it
* fix it
* deliver
* ask for testimonial and referrals

**pricing guide:**

* simple chatbot: $500-800
* appointment automation: $1,000-1,500
* email automation: $800-1,200
* data processing: $1,500-2,000
* custom complex solution: $2,000-3,000
* monthly maintenance: $200-500

**common questions:**

"do i need to be a good coder?"

* nope. if you can follow a tutorial and troubleshoot errors, you're good

"what if someone asks for something i don't know how to build?"

* say yes, figure it out later. chatgpt is your coworker

"how do i find clients?"

* local business facebook groups, linkedin dms, in-person networking, cold email

"what if my solution breaks?"

* charge for maintenance or fix it for free if it's in first month. shit happens.

"is this sustainable?"

* yeah. every business needs this. market is huge and most haven't adopted ai yet

**the honest truth:**

* this isn't passive income, you trade time for money
* but $10k/month working 20-30 hours is solid
* scales if you hire or productize common solutions
* real businesses need this now, not hypothetically
* most ai bros are selling courses, not doing client work (client work actually pays)

you don't need to be a genius or have a cs degree. you need to solve boring problems for businesses who will pay you. that's it.
