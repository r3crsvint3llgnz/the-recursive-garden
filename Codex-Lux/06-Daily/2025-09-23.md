## Capture (Inbox)

- Sleep better than previous nights, but still hard to fall asleep.  

- Reading at night doesn’t make me sleepy. Currently on *Slow Productivity* (Cal Newport) and *A Brief History of Thought* (Luc Ferry).  

- Curiosity: Greek philosophy ↔ Egypt (Pythagoras’ theorem origins, mystery cults’ influence).  

- Obsidian setup for work + iPad: want it to feel agentic, not just storage.  

- Brendan: paid him for chores, unclear if done. He’s spending more, now working at Whataburger → need to shift from provider to mentor.  

- Work: discussion with Cindy, Sentil, Kartik. Team unprepared, fumbling. Need AWS ingestion pipeline.  

- Health slipping: no more 3–5 mile walks, gaining weight, eating more. Doctor appointment tomorrow.

## Daily Log (Notes)
