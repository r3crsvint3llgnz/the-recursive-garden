# ACID - Consistency

> [!tip]- Distillation — one idea, in my words
> - Write the irreducible insight. 50–120 words.
> - State the claim/definition in one sentence first.
> - Remove source phrasing; keep mechanism or rule.
> - If you feel the need for “and,” split into another atom.

> [!info]- Why it matters – 1-3 bullets on utility, mechanism, implication.
> - What decision does this change?
> - What prediction does this enable?
> - What failure does this prevent?

> [!question]- Links
> - Does this collide/agree with an existing atom?
> - Add at least one forward link to a molecule/canonical note.
