# Bistable potential and Kramers escape

## Purpose
Test whether persistent distinctions correspond to suppressed transition rates.

## Links to claims
- [[02-Projects/Claims and Hypotheses/Persistent distinction equals suppressed transition rate\|Persistent distinction equals suppressed transition rate]]

## System
Particle in a double-well potential with thermal noise.

## Setup
- Control parameters: barrier height, noise strength
- Noise model: Gaussian white noise
- Initial conditions: ensemble localized in one well

## Distinction definition
- Effective variable: position
- Partition: left well vs right well

## Measurement / metric
- Mean first-passage time
- Escape rate distribution
- Lifetime scaling with barrier height

## Expected outcomes
- If claim holds: exponential dependence of lifetime on barrier height.
- If claim fails: weak or no correlation.
