# Coarse graining erases distinctions

## Purpose
Demonstrate that distinctions are scale-relative but ontically real.

## Links to claims
- [[02-Projects/Claims and Hypotheses/Coarse graining determines which distinctions exist\|Coarse graining determines which distinctions exist]]

## System
Multiscale stochastic reaction network or coupled oscillators.

## Setup
- Micro variables: individual state components
- Macro variables: averaged or projected observables
- Noise: intrinsic stochasticity

## Distinction definition
- Fine partition: microstate pattern
- Coarse partition: macrostate equivalence class

## Measurement / metric
- Predictive divergence of future ensembles
- Mutual information decay across scales

## Expected outcomes
- If claim holds: predictive distinction disappears under coarse graining.
- If claim fails: distinction remains invariant.
