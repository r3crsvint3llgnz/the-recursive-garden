[[02-Projects/The Recursive Garden/About\|← About]]

> [!abstract]+ Fiction in progress
> - **Wake (near-future SF).** Humanity finds ancient, indifferent star vessels. We live in their wake like dolphins pacing cruise ships — fascination without contact. The story follows what people build in the shadow of indifference.
> - **Devil’s Backbone (horror).** An information-parasitic entity — **Ixchel** — propagates like a recursive algorithm through ritual, worship, and modern platforms. It exploits broken error-correction in human groups.
