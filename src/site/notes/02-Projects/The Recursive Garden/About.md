# About this garden

This is a public working notebook. I publish notes to make thinking visible and testable. Expect revisions, dead ends, and occasional rewrites.

## Who I am
Autistic systems thinker. Builder and DIYer. I learn by taking things apart, naming the parts, and making something useful from them. Most of my work here turns raw curiosity into repeatable methods and artifacts.

## What I’m exploring
- **Recursive Distinction Dynamics (RDD).** A working theory/philosophical framework: reality can be modeled as distinctions that recurse; time, coherence, and agency fall out of that process. I’m formalizing definitions, constraints, and examples. Not doctrine—work in progress.
- **PKM as publishing.** Moving from private notes to public artifacts with provenance, evaluation, and versioning.
- **Agentic tools.** Small, auditable workflows that actually reduce effort.
- **Reading and review.** Short, falsifiable summaries tied to future decisions or stories.

## Fiction in progress
- **Wake.** Near-future SF. Humanity finds ancient, indifferent star vessels. We exist in their wake like dolphins pacing cruise ships—fascination without contact. The story follows what people build in the shadow of indifference.
- **Devil’s Backbone.** Horror. An information-parasitic entity—**Ixchel**—propagates like a recursive algorithm through ritual, worship, and modern platforms. It exploits broken error-correction in human groups. Science, cognition, and belief are the terrain.

## How to read this place
- **Hubs** collect stable notes: [[Recursive Distinction Dynamics (Hub)\|Recursive Distinction Dynamics (Hub)]], [[Open PKM (Hub)\|Open PKM (Hub)]], [[Reading Notes (Hub)\|Reading Notes (Hub)]], [[Fiction Projects (Hub)\|Fiction Projects (Hub)]].
- Notes carry a status: `seed | draft | stable | canonical`. Seeds may be wrong; that’s allowed.

## Working rules
- Publish early; correct in public.
- Prefer atoms (precise definitions) and molecules (short syntheses) over long essays.
- Link only when the dependency matters.
- Track assumptions separately from results.

## Minimal background
Industry experience in optimization, evaluation, and agentic workflows. Competent with WSL2, VS Code, Python/Node, AWS, SQLite, GitHub, Obsidian/Netlify. Tools are secondary to constraints.
