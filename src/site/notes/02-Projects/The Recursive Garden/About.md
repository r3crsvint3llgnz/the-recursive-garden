>
> I’m Seth.
>
> I’m an autistic systems thinker who understands the world by **taking things apart and seeing how they fit together**. I learn by building: wiring, fixing, coding, printing, testing. Naming the parts helps me reason about them, communicate them, and reuse them.
>
> Autism, for me, shows up as a strong bias toward structure, pattern, and explicit reasoning. I am less comfortable with vague consensus and more comfortable with clearly stated assumptions, constraints, and failure modes. That shapes how I think, how I document work, and how I collaborate.
>
> Most of what I publish starts as curiosity and becomes something operational: a definition, a model, a workflow, or a story that survives contact with reality.

> [!question] How I work
> I treat thinking as a science or engineering activity.
>
> That means:
> - breaking questions into parts that can be inspected,
> - separating assumptions from results,
> - testing ideas against constraints instead of intuition,
> - and revising explanations when they fail.
>
> This garden exists to make that process visible.

> [!work] What I do professionally (now)
> I work at the intersection of **industrial operations and intelligent systems**.
>
> My focus is bringing AI, advanced process control, and decision models into real manufacturing environments: safely, reliably, and with measurable impact.
>
> When these systems work well, the outcome is not just better performance metrics. It is calmer operations, clearer decision-making, and fewer surprises for the people running the plant.

> [!success] Impact snapshot
> - Production-grade deployments **inside live operating units** (not pilots)
> - Impact measured in plant outcomes: ↑ throughput, ↑ stability, ↓ energy intensity
> - Documented **multi-million** operational improvements within the last year
> - Early-majority adoption across production, maintenance, engineering, and commercial teams

> [!summary] How this garden fits
> This site is not a portfolio of conclusions.
>
> It is a record of **process**: how problems are framed, how explanations are stress-tested, and how ideas evolve under constraint.
>
> If you are evaluating how I think, build, or communicate, this garden is the most direct artifact I have.
