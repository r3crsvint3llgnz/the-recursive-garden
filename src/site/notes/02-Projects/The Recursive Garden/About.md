# About this garden

> [!abstract]+ What this is
> This garden is my public thinking space. It’s where I work things out in the open, follow questions that pull at me, and shape ideas into something clearer. Notes here change as I do. Some grow, some get replaced, some get refactored into better versions. Curiosity leads; rigor keeps me honest.

> [!info] Who I am
> ![sethrobins.jpg|220](/img/user/02-Projects/The%20Recursive%20Garden/_assets/sethrobins.jpg)
>
> I’m an autistic systems thinker who learns by taking things apart and seeing how they fit together. I’ve always been a builder; wiring, fixing, coding, printing, testing. Making things helps me understand the world, and naming the parts helps me explain it.
>Most of what I publish here begins as raw curiosity and becomes something structured: a method, a definition, a model, or a story.
---

> [!info]+ What I’m exploring
> - **Recursive Distinction Dynamics (RDD)**. A working theory about how reality builds itself from differences. Draw a boundary, let it recurse, and watch time, coherence, meaning, and agency emerge. This is still early work — a mix of philosophy, information theory, and testable structure.
> - **PKM as publishing**. Turning private notes into public artifacts, complete with provenance and versioning, so thinking isn’t just stored but improved.
> - **Agentic tools**. Lightweight, auditable workflows that take real work off my plate. Not hype, practical tools that actually reduce effort.
> - **Reading & review**. Brief, falsifiable summaries that sharpen understanding and feed back into projects, writing, and research.
---

> [!example]+ Fiction in progress
> - **Wake (near-future SF).** Humanity finds ancient, indifferent star vessels. We live in their wake like dolphins pacing cruise ships—fascination without contact. The story follows what people build in the shadow of indifference.  
> - **Devil’s Backbone (horror).** An information-parasitic entity—**Ixchel**—propagates like a recursive algorithm through ritual, worship, and modern platforms. It exploits broken error-correction in human groups. Science, cognition, and belief are the terrain.
---

> [!hint]- Working rules
> - I publish early and refine in public.
> - I prefer atoms (tiny, precise definitions) and molecules (short syntheses) over long essays.
> - I link only when it clarifies a dependency.
> - I track assumptions separately from results so I know what changed and why.
---

> [!abstract]+ What I do (now)
> I work on the frontier between industrial operations and intelligent systems. My focus is bringing AI, advanced process control, and decision models into real industrial manufacturing: safely, reliably, and with measurable impact.
> I enjoy problems that sit at the intersection of physics, human judgment, and computation. When these systems work well, you don’t just improve a process; you make people’s work lives better, calmer, and more predictable.

> [!success]+ Impact snapshot
> - Production-grade deployments **inside** operating units (not pilots)  
> - Measured in plant outcomes: ↑ throughput, ↑ stability, ↓ energy intensity  
> - Documented **multi-million** operational improvement within the last year  
> - Early-majority adoption across production, maintenance, engineering, commercial
---

> [!note]+ Operating principles
> - **Safety and control are non-negotiable.** Architect for fail-safe behavior.  
> - **Machines monitor and execute precision; humans keep judgment.**  
> - **Cost-aware models.** Add complexity only when it pays for itself in performance.  
> - **Tight feedback loops.** Build for continuous measurement and iteration.

> [!info]+ Core stack & tooling
> **Industrial/controls.** DCS/PLC/SCADA (MPC/APC hooks, interlocks, ISA-88/ISA-18.2), historians & events (PI/AF, Canary, PHD), OPC UA/DA, Modbus/TCP, MQTT **Sparkplug B**, Kepware/UA gateways, PI Vision / Ignition HMI, alarm hygiene & MOC.
>
> **Data & plumbing.** Python/Node on WSL2; pandas/NumPy/statsmodels; SQLite, Postgres, DuckDB; Parquet/Arrow; Kafka/Redpanda, MQTT brokers; lightweight ETL; cost/constraint models for ops metrics.
>
> **ML & optimization.** scikit-learn, XGBoost; feature stores (lite); OR-Tools/PuLP (LP/MIP); time-series forecasting & variance reduction; model monitoring in production contexts.
>
> **LLMs & agentic systems.** Prompt design & **tool-use/function calling**, structured outputs (JSON Schema/Pydantic), RAG (FAISS/Chroma/pgvector), LangChain/LlamaIndex when useful, small custom agents (policies, evaluators, planners), evals/guardrails (RAGAS-style checks, deterministic parsers), observability (Langfuse/W&B).
>
> **Orchestration & CI.** Node-RED, n8n; Airflow/Prefect; GitHub Actions/Jenkins; Task Scheduler/systemd; FastAPI/Flask microservices; Docker/Compose for edge deploys.
>
> **Cloud & infra.** AWS (S3, Lambda, Step Functions, ECS/Fargate, IoT Core/Greengrass, Timestream); VPC/VPN/PrivateLink; secrets management; Grafana/Prometheus/CloudWatch.
>
> **Dev & publishing.** VS Code, GitHub, Jupyter, Obsidian → Netlify static publishing; dashboards for control-room consumption.
>
> **Principle.** Machines handle precision & monitoring; humans keep higher-order judgment—**safety and control are non-negotiable**.

> [!example]+ Selected initiatives (condensed)
> - **Intelligent control & optimization** inside high-margin chemical production  
> - **Variance reduction** and **throughput/energy** improvements via APC + ML  
> - **Mobile, intrinsically safe operations** (smart devices, plant Wi-Fi, connected workflows) to prepare for intelligence-driven plants  
> - **Capability development** for control, analyzers, and power—training aligned to live risk controls and standards
---

> [!timeline]+ Roles (short)
> - **AI Adoption Consultant** — design + deploy intelligent control/optimization in live production  
> - **Industrial Mobility & Intelligent Ops Architect** — intrinsically safe mobile operations, connected worker apps  
> - **Process Control Capability Development** — site-wide learning programs for control/automation disciplines  
> - **MES / Data Asset Engineer** — historian → asset management, reliability and efficiency projects  
> - Earlier: process control engineering, instrumentation, and instruction (hands-on to systems)
---

> [!tip]- Where this intersects the garden
> **RDD** shows up in how systems maintain boundaries, stability, and coherence.
> **PKM** becomes a way to turn operational learning into templates and tools.
> **Agentic systems** become practical extensions of the same principles: humans set direction; machines support precision and awareness.
