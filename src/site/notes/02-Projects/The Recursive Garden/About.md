# About this garden

> [!abstract]+ What this is
> A public working notebook. I publish notes to make thinking visible and testable.  
> Expect revisions, dead ends, and occasional rewrites. Rigor matters; curiosity is welcome.
---

> [!note]+ Who I am
> Autistic systems thinker. Builder and DIYer.  
> I learn by taking things apart, naming the parts, and making something useful from them.  
> Most of my work here turns raw curiosity into repeatable methods and artifacts.
---

> [!info]+ What I’m exploring
> - **Recursive Distinction Dynamics (RDD).** Working theory: model reality as distinctions that recurse; time, coherence, and agency fall out of that process. I’m formalizing definitions, constraints, and examples. Not doctrine—work in progress.  
> - **PKM as publishing.** Moving from private notes to public artifacts with provenance, evaluation, and versioning.  
> - **Agentic tools.** Small, auditable workflows that actually reduce effort.  
> - **Reading & review.** Short, falsifiable summaries tied to future decisions or stories.
---

> [!example]+ Fiction in progress
> - **Wake (near-future SF).** Humanity finds ancient, indifferent star vessels. We live in their wake like dolphins pacing cruise ships—fascination without contact. The story follows what people build in the shadow of indifference.  
> - **Devil’s Backbone (horror).** An information-parasitic entity—**Ixchel**—propagates like a recursive algorithm through ritual, worship, and modern platforms. It exploits broken error-correction in human groups. Science, cognition, and belief are the terrain.

> [!tip]+ How to read this place
> **Hubs** collect stable notes:  
> → [[Recursive Distinction Dynamics (Hub)\|Recursive Distinction Dynamics (Hub)]] · [[Open PKM (Hub)\|Open PKM (Hub)]] · [[Reading Notes (Hub)\|Reading Notes (Hub)]] · [[Fiction Projects (Hub)\|Fiction Projects (Hub)]]  
> Notes carry a status: `seed | draft | stable | canonical`. Seeds may be wrong—learning in public is the point.
---

> [!hint]- Working rules
> - Publish early; correct in public.  
> - Prefer **atoms** (precise definitions) and **molecules** (short syntheses) over long essays.  
> - Link only when the dependency matters.  
> - Track **assumptions** separately from **results**.
---

> [!abstract]+ What I do (now)
> I build the next frontier of industrial operations: systems that move beyond traditional automation toward **autonomous control**.  
> My lane sits where **Advanced Process Control (APC)**, **applied machine learning**, and **agentic decision systems** meet to improve **live** chemical production in real time—throughput, stability, energy, and margin together.
---

> [!success]+ Impact snapshot
> - Production-grade deployments **inside** operating units (not pilots)  
> - Measured in plant outcomes: ↑ throughput, ↑ stability, ↓ energy intensity  
> - Documented **multi-million** operational improvement within the last year  
> - Early-majority adoption across production, maintenance, engineering, commercial
---

> [!note]+ Operating principles
> - **Safety and control are non-negotiable.** Architect for fail-safe behavior.  
> - **Machines monitor and execute precision; humans keep judgment.**  
> - **Cost-aware models.** Add complexity only when it pays for itself in performance.  
> - **Tight feedback loops.** Build for continuous measurement and iteration.
---

> [!info]+ Core stack & tooling
> **Industrial/controls.** DCS/PLC/SCADA (MPC/APC hooks, interlocks, ISA-88/ISA-18.2), historians & events (PI/AF, Canary, PHD), OPC UA/DA, Modbus/TCP, MQTT **Sparkplug B**, Kepware/UA gateways, PI Vision / Ignition HMI, alarm hygiene & MOC.
>
> **Data & plumbing.** Python/Node on WSL2; pandas/NumPy/statsmodels; SQLite, Postgres, DuckDB; Parquet/Arrow; Kafka/Redpanda, MQTT brokers; lightweight ETL; cost/constraint models for ops metrics.
>
> **ML & optimization.** scikit-learn, XGBoost; feature stores (lite); OR-Tools/PuLP (LP/MIP); time-series forecasting & variance reduction; model monitoring in production contexts.
>
> **LLMs & agentic systems.** Prompt design & **tool-use/function calling**, structured outputs (JSON Schema/Pydantic), RAG (FAISS/Chroma/pgvector), LangChain/LlamaIndex when useful, small custom agents (policies, evaluators, planners), evals/guardrails (RAGAS-style checks, deterministic parsers), observability (Langfuse/W&B).
>
> **Orchestration & CI.** Node-RED, n8n; Airflow/Prefect; GitHub Actions/Jenkins; Task Scheduler/systemd; FastAPI/Flask microservices; Docker/Compose for edge deploys.
>
> **Cloud & infra.** AWS (S3, Lambda, Step Functions, ECS/Fargate, IoT Core/Greengrass, Timestream); VPC/VPN/PrivateLink; secrets management; Grafana/Prometheus/CloudWatch.
>
> **Dev & publishing.** VS Code, GitHub, Jupyter, Obsidian → Netlify static publishing; dashboards for control-room consumption.
>
> **Principle.** Machines handle precision & monitoring; humans keep higher-order judgment—**safety and control are non-negotiable**.

> [!example]+ Selected initiatives (condensed)
> - **Intelligent control & optimization** inside high-margin chemical production  
> - **Variance reduction** and **throughput/energy** improvements via APC + ML  
> - **Mobile, intrinsically safe operations** (smart devices, plant Wi-Fi, connected workflows) to prepare for intelligence-driven plants  
> - **Capability development** for control, analyzers, and power—training aligned to live risk controls and standards
---

> [!timeline]+ Roles (short)
> - **AI Adoption Consultant** — design + deploy intelligent control/optimization in live production  
> - **Industrial Mobility & Intelligent Ops Architect** — intrinsically safe mobile operations, connected worker apps  
> - **Process Control Capability Development** — site-wide learning programs for control/automation disciplines  
> - **MES / Data Asset Engineer** — historian → asset management, reliability and efficiency projects  
> - Earlier: process control engineering, instrumentation, and instruction (hands-on to systems)
---

> [!tip]- Where this intersects the garden
> - **RDD / formalism.** How persistence, coherence, and cost show up in real plants.  
> - **PKM as publishing.** Turning ops work into reusable templates, tests, and decision aids.  
> - **Agentic tools.** Small, auditable workflows that reduce effort and surface signals sooner.
