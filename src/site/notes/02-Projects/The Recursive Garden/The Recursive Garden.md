# The Recursive Garden

A procedural environment for cultivating ideas through **aesthetic recursion**—publishing notes that are meant to be revised, tested, and sometimes replaced.

## Orientation
This is a public working system by **Seth Robins**. The intent is to **explore and formalize** a philosophical framework (RDD) while developing related work: PKM methods, book-derived syntheses, critical reviews, and fiction. Notes are hypotheses and draftable artifacts, not final statements.

## Working Definition (RDD)
> **Recursive Distinction Dynamics (RDD)** is a **working framework**: reality is modeled as distinctions that recursively feed their outputs into the next round of boundary-making. Time, causality, coherence, and agency are treated as **consequences** of that process.  
> This definition is provisional and will evolve as the formalism improves.

## Paths
Curated entry points. Hubs favor stable/canonical notes; drafts remain visible but de-emphasized.
- [[02-Projects/Recursive Distinction Dynamics\|Recursive Distinction Dynamics (Hub)]]
- [[Open PKM\|Open PKM (Hub)]]
- [[04-Resources/Reading Notes\|Reading Notes (Hub)]]
- [[Reviews & Insights\|Reviews & Insights (Hub)]]
- [[Fiction Projects\|Fiction Projects (Hub)]]
- [[02-Projects/The Recursive Garden/About\|About]]
## Working Rules
- Publish early; mark status: `seed | draft | stable | canonical`.
- Prefer atoms (definitions) and molecules (syntheses) over long unstructured prose.
- Link only when the link clarifies an argument or formal dependency.
- Revise or retire notes when better formalizations emerge.

## Latest Growth
Recent public changes across the garden.
