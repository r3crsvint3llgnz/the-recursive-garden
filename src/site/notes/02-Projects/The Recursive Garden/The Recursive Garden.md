# The Recursive Garden

 A field guide to a **live inquiry at the confluence** of science, technology, and philosophy. This garden hosts notes, models, and stories that test how new tools and old questions reshape one another. I’m Seth Robins; you’re invited to explore, critique, and build alongside me.

 > [!quote]+ Why this space exists
> We’re living through overlapping breakthroughs in AI, information theory, and cognitive science.  
> This garden treats their **convergence** as an experimental landscape: ideas are seeded, tested, revised, or retired.  
> **Rigor matters; curiosity is welcome.** — *Seth Robins*
---

> [!abstract]+ Orientation
> This is a public working system. You’ll find:
> - **Open PKM** methods & research workflows
> - **Book syntheses** and critical reviews
> - **Applied AI** notes from industry
> - **Fiction sandboxes** that pressure-test concepts
> - One formal thread: **Recursive Distinction Dynamics (RDD)**
>
> *Notes are hypotheses and draftable artifacts, not final statements.*

> **Survey (2–5 min)** · skim light notes

> **Tools & practice (10–20 min)** · templates & workflows

> [!abstract]+ Working Definition (RDD) — one thread among many
> **RDD (working):** model reality as **distinctions** that feed their outputs into the **next round** of boundary-making; treat time, causality, coherence, and agency as **consequences** of that recursion.
>
> **Plain gloss.** Make a cut (this | that). Feed it forward. Repeat.  
> Patterns like time, cause, and choice appear—and can be tested.

> [!tip]+ How to read this garden
> - **Statuses:** `seed | draft | stable | canonical`
> - **Atoms vs molecules:** tight definitions vs syntheses/claims
> - **Evidence beats vibes:** important claims get a toy model, failure case, or cost/constraint
> - **Versioning:** replaced notes keep pointers to successors; dead ends stay visible
