> [!info] Orientation
> I’m Seth.
>
> This is a public working lab where I think out loud in writing.
>
> You’re not looking at a finished body of work. You’re looking at **how I approach problems**: how I break them down, test ideas against reality, build tools, and revise explanations when they fail.
> 
> If you want more context on my background, the kinds of problems I work on, and how this garden fits into my professional work, start here:
→ [[02-Projects/The Recursive Garden/About - Contact Info\|About me and my work]]

> [!important] A concrete example
> **Question:** What makes a distinction persist instead of dissolving into noise?
>
> **How I break it apart:**
> - What physical or informational boundary defines the distinction?
> - What noise or pressure acts to erase it?
> - What mechanisms suppress that erosion over time?
>
> **What progress looks like here:**
> Short notes, diagrams, models, and testable claims that get refined or discarded as understanding improves.

> [!note] Workbench
> These are not topics. They are **questions and pressure points** that keep recurring across engineering, AI, systems design, and storytelling.
>
> Each entry below drops you into live notes, partial models, or applied work in progress. Think of this as a snapshot of what my attention is currently organized around.
