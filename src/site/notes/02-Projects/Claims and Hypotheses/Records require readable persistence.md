# Records require readable persistence

## Claim
A persistent distinction functions as a record only if it can be accessed repeatedly without significantly accelerating its decay.

## Definitions used
- [[04-Resources/Atoms/Record (Memory Substrate)\|Record (Memory Substrate)]]
- [[04-Resources/Atoms/Persistent Distinction\|Persistent Distinction]]
- [[04-Resources/Atoms/Recursion\|Recursion]]

## Predictions
1. Increasing readout coupling strength reduces record lifetime.
2. Below a coupling threshold, readout does not significantly affect persistence.

## Operationalization
- System: bistable memory element
- Readout: controlled coupling channel
- Metric: lifetime vs read frequency
- Threshold: onset of back-action-induced decay

## Disconfirming outcomes
- Readout has no effect on persistence.
- All readout destroys records equally.
