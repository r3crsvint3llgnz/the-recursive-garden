# Persistent distinction equals suppressed transition rate

## Claim
A persistent distinction corresponds to a measurable suppression of transition rates across a defined partition of effective state space relative to noise-driven diffusion.

## Definitions used
- [[04-Resources/Atoms/Distinction\|Distinction]]
- [[04-Resources/Atoms/Persistent Distinction\|Persistent Distinction]]
- [[Coarse Graining\|Coarse Graining]]
- [[04-Resources/Atoms/Noise\|Noise]]

## Predictions
1. Increasing barrier height or constraint strength monotonically increases distinction lifetime.
2. At fixed noise strength, the inverse transition rate predicts usable memory duration.

## Operationalization
- System: bistable or metastable dynamical system
- State variables: coarse-grained order parameter
- Partition: basin membership
- Metric: escape rate / mean first-passage time
- Timescale: relative to intrinsic noise correlation time

## Disconfirming outcomes
- Transition rates do not correlate with constraint strength.
- Distinction lifetime is not predictable from escape statistics.
