# Coarse graining determines which distinctions exist

## Claim
A distinction may exist at one effective coarse graining while disappearing at another, without any change to underlying microdynamics.

## Definitions used
- [[Coarse Graining\|Coarse Graining]]
- [[04-Resources/Atoms/State Space\|State Space]]
- [[04-Resources/Atoms/Distinction\|Distinction]]

## Predictions
1. A partition predictive at fine resolution loses predictive power when coarse grained.
2. Entropy production increases as distinctions vanish under coarse graining.

## Operationalization
- System: stochastic dynamical system with multiple scales
- State variables: micro vs macro observables
- Partition: defined at micro scale
- Metric: predictive divergence of future ensembles
- Timescale: across relaxation hierarchy

## Disconfirming outcomes
- Predictive distinctions remain invariant across coarse graining.
- Coarse graining never alters causal relevance.
