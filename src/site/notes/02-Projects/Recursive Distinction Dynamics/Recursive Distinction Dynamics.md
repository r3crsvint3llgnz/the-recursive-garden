## What problem is this trying to solve?

Why does *anything* persist instead of dissolving into uniformity?
Why does time seem to flow in one direction rather than none at all?
Why are some patterns stable enough to become atoms, rocks, brains, or people?
And why do a small number of those patterns experience the universe from the inside?

**Recursive Distinction Dynamics (RDD)** is an attempt to explore these questions by focusing on a simple physical idea:

**some differences persist, and because they persist, they shape what can happen next.**

Rather than treating reality as made of static substances, RDD treats it as structured by **dynamical differences that last long enough to matter**.

---
## The idea in plain language

Imagine a perfectly uniform physical situation.
No differences. No structure.
Nothing interesting can happen.

Now imagine a difference appears.

If it disappears immediately, nothing follows.
If it **persists**, it begins to constrain the future.

Persisting differences shape behavior.
Interacting constraints accumulate history.
When present behavior depends on recorded past states, time becomes ordered.
When systems begin tracking and updating their own state through that process, experience becomes possible.

RDD is an attempt to make this chain **explicit, physical, and testable**.
Not as a finished theory, but as a framework for asking sharper questions and designing experiments.

## Scope and intent

RDD does not propose new physical laws.
It reorganizes existing physics around a single question:

What has to be true, physically, for a difference to keep making a difference?

The framework treats familiar ideas like state space, noise, entropy, and records as tools, not assumptions, and discards concepts that do not correspond to real dynamical structure.

Its purpose is to connect time, memory, information, and experience to measurable physical conditions, and to generate explanations that can fail through experiment rather than survive by interpretation.

---
## The RDD ontology

RDD organizes its concepts into two working categories:

- **Atoms** — irreducible physical conditions or constraints.
- **Molecules** — phenomena that emerge when those conditions interact under noise and dissipation.

Atoms define the building blocks.
Molecules describe what those blocks make possible.

Choose your entry point based on whether you want definitions or consequences.

## What this is — and what it isn’t

RDD does **not** propose new physical laws, redefine entropy, or claim to solve consciousness.

It proposes a shift in starting point:

- persistence rather than substance,
- a shared physical basis for time, memory, and information,
- and concepts that can be sharpened into measurements and experiments.

If RDD fails, it will fail by making **wrong predictions about persistence, transition rates, or record stability**.  
That exposure to failure is deliberate.

This page is a starting point.  
The rest of the project explores how far this explanatory thread can be pulled before it breaks.

## **Working Rules**

- **Atom**  
    An irreducible ontic definition that identifies a real dynamical property or constraint.
    
    An Atom must:
    - connect to at least one other Atom, and
    - admit an operational or experimental interpretation in principle.
        
- **Molecule**  
    An emergent phenomenon arising from the interaction of two or more Atoms under specified constraints and noise.  
    Molecules generate **testable claims**, not new primitives.
    
- **Distinction Criterion (Ontic Test)**  
    A concept is ontically real only if it can be expressed as a **partition of effective state space that produces statistically distinguishable future dynamics** under identical conditions.
    
- **Persistence Criterion (Realness Test)**  
    A concept is physically real only if it explains **how and why a distinction persists against noise** over a defined timescale.  
    Transient differences may be causally relevant, but only persistent distinctions can ground memory, records, or recursion.
    
- **Scale Rule (Coarse Graining Constraint)**  
    All ontic claims are **scale-relative**.  
    A distinction may exist at one effective coarse graining and disappear at another without becoming epistemic or subjective.
    
- **Recursion Rule**  
    If a concept cannot be described as a **record-mediated update of system state**, it does not participate in recursion and cannot explain time, memory, or agency.
    
- **Entropy Check**  
    If a concept does not specify the constraints or mechanisms that suppress equilibration, it describes **entropy or decay**, not structure.
    
- **Experiment Rule**  
    A valid concept or molecule must either:
    - correspond to an existing measurable quantity, or
    - motivate a **falsifiable experimental program** specifying what would count as confirmation or disconfirmation.
        
- **No Semantic Substitution Rule**  
    Replacing dynamical explanations with labels, intentions, meanings, or interpretations without specifying physical mechanisms is prohibited.
