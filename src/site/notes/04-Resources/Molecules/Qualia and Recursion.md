# Qualia and Recursion

> [!abstract]+ Summary
> This molecule elaborates on the Recursion atom, focusing on the relationship between recursion and qualia in Recursive Distinction Dynamics.

> [!info]+ Definition
> Explores how recursion and qualia interact in RDD, and why that synthesis is necessary.

> [!hint]+ Scope
> This note explains interactions and implications. It does not introduce new primitives.

## Molecule Content

References to “Qualia” and “What is Reality under RDD” from the original Recursion atom are discussed here, including their implications for subjective experience and recursive modeling.

[!warning]+ Source Needed

- For explicit connection between recursion and qualia, further philosophical and neuroscientific sources are required.
