# Reality (RDD)

> [!abstract]+ Summary
> In Recursive Distinction Dynamics, **Reality is not a container of things**. It is the **set of persistent distinctions that survive repeated interaction with noise under constraint**.
---

> [!info]+ Definition
> **Reality (\(\mathcal{R}\))** is the aggregate domain of all distinctions \(\mathcal{D}\) that satisfy the criterion of **persistence under interaction**.
>
> \[
> \mathcal{R} = \{ \mathcal{D} \mid \Pi(\mathcal{D}) > \text{Noise}(\mathcal{D}) \;\text{given constraints} \} > \]
>
> Reality is therefore the **sediment of successful dynamics**: the structures that remain when transient fluctuations have decayed.
---

> [!hint]+ Scope
> This note covers persistence, ontology, and pattern survival. It does not introduce new primitives.

## Core Insight

- Reality is not “what exists instantaneously,” but **what persists**.
- Persistence is not guaranteed; it is earned through resistance to noise.
- Stability is graded, not binary.
- Reality is the historical accumulation of patterns that survive.

> **To be real is to continue to affect the world across updates.**

---
## Connections

- **Evolutionary Epistemology**  
  Patterns survive because they work, not because they are chosen.
- **Decoherence and Classical Emergence**  
  Classical reality arises from quantum dynamics through suppression of interference, not collapse by observation.
- **Simulation and Rendering Metaphors**  
  Reality resembles a rendered output only insofar as it is the _currently stabilized state_ of an underlying process.

These are analogies, not commitments.

## Worked Example

> [!example]- Worked example (edit inline)
> **Before (bad):**
> A rock is real because it is made of atoms.  
> A dream is not real because it is neural activity.
>
> **After (pattern applied):**
> A rock is **high-persistence reality**. Its distinction pattern has survived immense noise and interaction over long timescales.
> A dream is **low-persistence reality**. It is real while it persists as a distinction within a perspective, but it lacks durability and collapses rapidly.
> **Conclusion:**  
> Reality is a **gradient of persistence**, not a binary classification.

## Anti-Patterns

> [!fail]- Anti-patterns
>
> - **The Container Fallacy**  
>   Treating spacetime as a box in which reality resides.  
>   Correction: spacetime is itself a stabilized distinction.
> - **The Observer Trap**  
>   Claiming reality depends on conscious observers.  
>   Correction: reality depends on persistence and interaction, not awareness.
> - **The Material Bias**  
>   Equating reality with matter alone.  
>   Correction: laws, constraints, and stable patterns can be more real than transient objects.

---
## Conflicts

- Naïve substance ontologies that treat matter as ontologically primitive.
- Observer-dependent accounts of reality.
- Purely instrumentalist views that deny ontic persistence.

---
## FAQ

> [!question]- FAQ (short answers)
>
> - Is a hallucination real in RDD?  
>   Yes, briefly. It exists as a distinction but fails to persist under interaction.
> - Does reality require a perspective?  
>   No. Perspectives _access_ reality; they do not create it. Persistence is ontic.
> - Can reality change?  
>   Yes. As constraints, interactions, or noise regimes change, different distinctions persist.
