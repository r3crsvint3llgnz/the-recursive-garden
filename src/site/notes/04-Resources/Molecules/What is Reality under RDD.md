## Insight or Idea
- Reality is not a container of things; it is a **survivorship bias** of information.
- Reality is the set of [[04-Resources/Atoms/Distinction (Persistent State-Space Partition)\|distinctions]] that have successfully withstood the pressure of [[04-Resources/Atoms/RDD – Gravity (Definition)\|Gravity]] (recursive persistence) without dissolving back into [[04-Resources/Atoms/RDD – Entropy (Definition)\|Entropy]].
- **"To be real is to persist across the update."**
## Connections
- Connects to **Evolutionary Epistemology** (survival of the fittest patterns).
- Connects to **Simulation Theory** (reality as rendered output).
- Connects to **Quantum Decoherence** (emergence of classical stability).

# Reality (RDD)

> [!abstract]+ Summary
> In Recursive Distinction Dynamics, Reality is defined not by "materiality," but by **Stability**. The Underlying Potential is infinite and chaotic; "Reality" is merely the subset of that potential that has achieved a stable, self-reinforcing orbit via Recursion. It is the "hardened" history of distinctions that resist modification.

>[!info]+ Definition
> **Reality ($\mathcal{R}$)**
> The aggregate domain of all [[04-Resources/Atoms/Distinction (Persistent State-Space Partition)\|distinctions]] ($\mathcal{D}$) that satisfy the condition of [[04-Resources/Atoms/Persistence (Metastable State Property)\|Persistence]] ($\Pi$) under the pressure of [[04-Resources/Atoms/RDD – Recursion (Definition)\|Recursion]] ($R$).
> 
> $$\mathcal{R} = \{ \mathcal{D} \mid \text{Gravity}(\mathcal{D}) > \text{Entropy}(\mathcal{D}) \}$$
> 
> Reality is the "sediment" of successful recursion. It is what remains when the noise cancels itself out.

> [!example]- Worked example (edit inline)
> **Before (Materialist View):**
> A rock is real because it is made of atoms. A dream is not real because it is made of neurons firing. Reality is determined by "stuff."
>
> **After (RDD Pattern Applied):**
> A rock is "High-Gravity Reality." Its [[04-Resources/Atoms/Distinction (Persistent State-Space Partition)\|distinction pattern]] has recurred for eons ($t \to \infty$) and requires immense energy to disrupt. It has deep Recursive Inertia.
> 
> A dream is "Low-Gravity Reality." It is a valid distinction pattern while it lasts ($E=1$), but it lacks [[04-Resources/Atoms/RDD – Gravity (Definition)\|Gravity]]. Upon the next major recursive update (waking up), its coherence collapses into entropy. It is "real" for a moment, but not "persistent."
> 
> **Conclusion:** Reality is a gradient of persistence, not a binary switch.

> [!fail]- Anti-patterns
> - **The Container Fallacy:** Believing Reality is a "box" (Spacetime) that things are put inside. (Correction: Spacetime is a distinction *generated* by the engine).
> - **The Solipsism Trap:** Believing that because Reality is perspective-dependent, it is "just in your head." (Correction: [[04-Resources/Atoms/RDD – Gravity (Definition)\|Gravity]] ensures that shared, high-persistence distinctions exist independently of any single ego).
> - **The Material Bias:** Assuming that only physical matter counts as real. (Correction: A "Law of Mathematics" is more real than a chair, because it has higher recursive stability).

> [!question]- FAQ (short answers)
> - **Is a hallucination real in RDD?**
>   Yes, but it is unstable. It exists as a distinction ($\mathcal{D}$) with a Perspective ($P$), but it fails the test of Interaction/Gravity ($G$) and dissolves quickly.
> - **Does Reality exist without an Observer?**
>   No. Reality requires a [[04-Resources/Atoms/RDD – Perspective (Definition)\|Perspective]] to carve it. However, "Observer" $\neq$ "Human." An electron is a perspective that maintains the reality of an atom.
> - **Can Reality change?**
>   Yes. Since Reality is just the current state of Recursion, if you change the distinctions being fed back into the loop (e.g., through technology or consciousness shift), you change the physical structure of Reality.
