# CODE

> [!abstract]+ Summary
---

 **CODE** (Capture, Organize, Distill, Express) is the fundamental operating system for modern knowledge work. It flips the traditional model of learning—which prioritizes memorization and categorization—in favor of **execution and output**. By treating information as a raw material that must move through a supply chain, CODE ensures that every piece of data consumed eventually contributes to a tangible result (The Express Phase), preventing the common trap of "Digital Hoarding."

>[!info]+ Definition
---

> A four-stage pipeline for processing information:
> 
> 1. **[[CODE - Capture\|Capture]]:** Save only what resonates. Don't capture everything; capture the 1% that sparks insight. (The Intake Valve).
>     
> 2. **[[CODE - Organize\|Organize]]:** Save for actionability, not by subject. Use the [[PARA Method\|PARA Method]] to place notes where they will be _used_, not where they belong. (The Sorting Floor).
>     
> 3. **[[CODE - Distill\|Distill]]:** Find the essence. Use [[Progressive Summarization\|Progressive Summarization]] to strip away the noise until only the core truth remains. (The Refinery).
>     
> 4. **[[CODE - Express\|Express]]:** Show your work. Combine distilled knowledge into [[Intermediate Packets\|Intermediate Packets]] or final deliverables. (The Shipping Dock).

> [!example]- Worked example (edit inline)
> **Before (bad):**
> 
> _Reading a book on AI Safety:_ You highlight 50 pages. You save the notes in a folder named "Books/Non-Fiction/AI." You never look at them again because the folder is an archive, not a workspace.
>
> **After (pattern applied):**
> 
> _Reading a book on AI Safety:_
> 
> 1. **Capture:** You highlight only the 3 paragraphs that relate to your current work.
>     
> 2. **Organize:** You save the note directly into the **Project Folder: Industrial AI OS**, not a generic "Books" folder.
>     
> 3. **Distill:** You bold the specific sentence about "Watchdog Timers."
>     
> 4. **Express:** You paste that bolded sentence into your LinkedIn article draft. The note is now "consumed."

> [!fail]- Anti-patterns
> - **The Collector's Fallacy:** Capturing thousands of articles but never moving to the "Distill" or "Express" phase. This creates debt, not value.
> - **The Librarian Trap:** Organizing by complex topics (Dewey Decimal style) rather than by active Projects. If a note isn't actionable, it's clogging the system.
> - **Over-Distilling:** Summarizing for the sake of summarizing, without a clear output vehicle (Blog, Report, Email) in mind.

- **Do I have to do all 4 steps for every note?** No. Most notes stop at Capture. Only Distill notes when you are actively using them for a project.
    
- **Which app should I use?** The tool matters less than the flow. Obsidian, Notion, and Evernote all work if the _process_ is respected.
    
- **How does this handle old notes?** If an old note isn't relevant to a current Project (Organize), it stays in the Archive. You don't need to "clean up" the past; you only need to curate the present.
