# Qualia

> [!abstract]+ Summary
> Qualia are not fundamental properties and not private mental substances. They are the **experienced aspect of a system that maintains a persistent, recursive, self-referential record of its own state over time**.
> In RDD, qualia emerge when a perspective does not merely recurse, but **recurses over its own records**, producing a structured internal history that is accessible to itself.

---

> [!info]+ Definition
> **Qualia** are the **phenomenological manifestation of recursive record-keeping within a perspective**, grounded in persistent distinctions, ordered in time, and stabilized against noise.
> They correspond to _what it is like_ for a system to be itself because the system carries a differentiated internal history.
> Formally (conceptually, not mathematically):
> \[
> \Phi = f(P,\; R,\; \text{Record},\; t)
> \]
> Where:
>
> - \(P\) is a [[04-Resources/Atoms/Perspective\|Perspective]],
> - \(R\) is [[04-Resources/Atoms/Recursion\|Recursion]] mediated by records,
> - \(t\) is [[04-Resources/Atoms/Time\|Time]] as ordered state change.

> [!hint]+ Scope
> This note covers emergence, structure, and phenomenology. It does not introduce new primitives.

## How qualia arise (RDD derivation)

Qualia appear only when **all** of the following are present:

1. **Persistent Distinctions**  
   The system maintains internal states that resist noise.

2. **Records**  
   Past distinctions are stored and carried forward.

3. **Recursive Update**  
   Current processing depends on prior records.

4. **Perspective**  
   Records are integrated relative to a stable internal reference frame.

5. **Self-access**  
   Some records encode aspects of the system’s own state or activity.

When any of these are missing, there is structure but no experience.

---

## Implications

- **Rocks**  
  Maintain distinctions, but lack recursive self-records.  
  → No qualia.

- **Thermostats**  
  Have records and feedback, but minimal depth and no self-model.  
  → Trivial or vanishing qualia.

- **Brains**  
  Maintain deep, layered, self-referential recursive records.  
  → Rich, structured qualia.

Qualia therefore scale with **recursive depth and self-modeling**, not with intelligence or biological status per se.

---

## What qualia are not

Qualia are **not**:

- fundamental particles or fields,
- non-physical properties,
- detached from physical dynamics,
- all-or-nothing phenomena.

They are **graded, structured, and contingent**.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Treating qualia as ontologically primitive.
- Equating qualia with raw sensory input.
- Assuming “experience” without memory.
- Collapsing qualia into language or reportability.

## Conflicts

- Panpsychist accounts that treat experience as fundamental.
- Views that decouple experience from memory or temporal structure.

---

## FAQ

**Do all recursive systems have qualia?**  
No. Only systems with _persistent, self-referential records_.

**Is this panpsychism?**  
No. Most systems lack the required structure.

**Can qualia be measured?**  
Indirectly, via recursive depth, record persistence, and self-model complexity.
