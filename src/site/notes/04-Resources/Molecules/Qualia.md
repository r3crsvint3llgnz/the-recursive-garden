# **Qualia ($\Phi$)**

- **Structure:** $P + R + t$.
    
- **Definition:** The structural history of a [[04-Resources/Atoms/RDD – Perspective (Definition)\|Perspective]]. Qualia is not "magic feeling"; it is the data-log of a specific Perspective's [[04-Resources/Atoms/RDD – Recursion (Definition)\|recursive]] trajectory through [[04-Resources/Atoms/RDD – Time (Definition)\|time]].
    
- **Implication:** Rocks have low-depth qualia; Brains have high-depth, self-modeling qualia.
