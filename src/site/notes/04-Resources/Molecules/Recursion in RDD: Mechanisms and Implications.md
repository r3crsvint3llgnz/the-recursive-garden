# Recursion in RDD: Mechanisms and Implications

> [!abstract]+ Summary
> This molecule elaborates on the Recursion atom, detailing the mechanisms and implications of recursion in Recursive Distinction Dynamics.

> [!info]+ Definition
> Recursion is not repetition and not self-reference by definition. It occurs when distinctions persist as records, records influence subsequent dynamics, state updates are ordered in time, and constraints and noise permit continuity rather than reset.

> [!hint]+ Scope
> This note covers mechanisms, implications, and formalization. It does not introduce new primitives.

## Mechanisms

Recursion requires time, persistence, and constrained interaction.

## Ontic / Core Claim

Recursion is not repetition and not self-reference by definition.  
It occurs when:

- distinctions persist as records,
- records influence subsequent dynamics,
- state updates are ordered in time,
- constraints and noise permit continuity rather than reset.

Formally, recursion can be expressed as:

\[
S\_{t+1} = F(S_t, R_t)
\]

where \(R_t\) denotes the record(s) carried forward from prior states.

Without records, systems evolve but do not recurse.

[!warning]+ Source Needed

- For formalization and mathematical treatment, see external sources in cybernetics and systems theory.

## Distillation

Recursion is memory acting on the present.

## Why it matters

- **Time:** Recursion depends on ordered state change.
- **Existence:** Persistent entities are sustained through recursive update.
- **Complexity:** Layered structure arises from repeated constrained updates.
- **RDD coherence:** Prevents circular definitions of process and state.

---

## Conflicts

- Purely logical or abstract notions of recursion
- Accounts that treat recursion as instantaneous self-reference
