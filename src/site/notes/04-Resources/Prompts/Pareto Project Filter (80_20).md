# Pareto Project Filter (80/20)

> [!info]+ Prompt — quick copy
---

Project: {{PROJECT}}.
Components/tasks: {{LIST}}.
Apply Pareto analysis:
- Identify the ~20% of tasks likely to create ~80% of value; explain why each is high leverage.
- Identify tasks to stop entirely (low ROI/busywork) with a one-line rationale.
Output two lists:
1) High-leverage 20%: Task | Value driver | Evidence/Rationale
2) Stop/Defer: Task | Why low ROI | Impact avoided
