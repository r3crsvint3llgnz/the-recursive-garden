# Energy Audit Mapper

> [!info]+ Prompt — quick copy
---

I'll describe my typical workday by hour with activity and energy: High/Medium/Low.
Analyze to find:
- Peak energy windows
- Fastest drains and their causes
- Tasks currently done at the wrong time
Propose an ideal daily schedule mapping task types to energy levels.
Output two parts:
1) Findings table: Hour | Activity | Energy | Issue | Recommendation
2) Ideal schedule: Time block → Task type → Rationale
