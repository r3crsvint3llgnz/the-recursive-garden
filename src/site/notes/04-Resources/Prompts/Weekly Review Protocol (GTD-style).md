# Weekly Review Protocol (GTD-style)

> [!info]+ Prompt — quick copy
---

Build a 20-minute weekly review for {{ROLE/CONTEXT}} using four phases:
1) Capture: list all inboxes to sweep + prompts to extract open loops.
2) Clarify: define next actions or outcomes for each captured item.
3) Organize: file into Projects, Next Actions, Waiting, Someday.
4) Reflect: 6–8 questions to spot risks/opportunities.
Add a simple 0–5 scoring rubric for the week (clarity, progress, load, mood) and a one-line trend note.
Output: checklist per phase + scoring grid template.
