_The Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe_ is a field manual for critical thinking in a noisy information environment. Novella and co-authors walk through logical fallacies, cognitive biases, and classic pseudoscience case studies, equipping readers with habits and tools to evaluate extraordinary claims without becoming cynics.
