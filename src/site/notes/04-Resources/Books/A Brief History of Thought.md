>[!abstract]+ Summary
---

*A Brief History of Thought* offers a concise tour of Western philosophy through a series of “spiritual families,” from ancient Greek wisdom to modern humanism. Ferry emphasizes how each major wave answers the question of how to live, and argues that contemporary secular humanism inherits, transforms, and sometimes misremembers those earlier traditions.
