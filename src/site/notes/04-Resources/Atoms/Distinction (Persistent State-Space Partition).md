# **Distinction**

## Definition

A **distinction** is an **ontic, persistent partition of a system’s state space**, produced by irreversible dynamics, such that the system’s future evolution depends asymmetrically on which side of the partition it occupies.

---

## Ontic core (what exists physically)

Ontically, a distinction exists when:

- a continuous degree of freedom becomes separated into **stable or metastable regions** of state space,
- transitions across those regions are **suppressed relative to thermal or stochastic noise**,
- the separation persists over a timescale long compared to the system’s characteristic fluctuation time,
- persistence is maintained through **dissipation and loss of microscopic reversibility**.

Such a partition exists independently of observation, interpretation, or representation.

---

## Relation to perspective (explicitly non-constitutive)

A distinction **may be accessed epistemically** by a system with a [[Perspective\|Perspective]], but perspective does not create the distinction.

Perspective determines:
- how an existing distinction is detected or resolved,
- how it is encoded (e.g. as a bit, category, or symbol),
- how it is used for inference, control, or action.

Ontic persistence constrains epistemic access; epistemic access does not generate ontic persistence.

Differences occur freely through fluctuation. A distinction exists only when irreversible dynamics make a difference persist and condition future behavior.

- **Foundations of information:** Explains why bits must be physically instantiated rather than assumed primitives.
- **Thermodynamics:** Connects entropy increase to the cost of maintaining persistent state-space partitions.
- **AI and cognition:** Separates representation (epistemic) from memory substrate (ontic), preventing category errors in learning systems.

Sources to investigate:
- **Landauer, R. (1961)** — “Information is Physical”: information requires physical instantiation.  
- **Bennett, C. (1982)** — Logical reversibility and thermodynamic cost.  
- **Seifert, U. (2012)** — Stochastic thermodynamics and irreversibility.  
- **Parrondo, Horowitz & Sagawa (2015)** — Thermodynamics of information.

These works address manipulation and accounting of information; this framework isolates the conditions under which distinctions persist in the first place.
