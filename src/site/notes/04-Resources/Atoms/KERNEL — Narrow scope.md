# KERNEL — Narrow scope

> [!tip]- Distillation — one idea, in my words
> - Write the irreducible insight. 50–120 words.
> - State the claim/definition in one sentence first.
> - Remove source phrasing; keep mechanism or rule.

One prompt, one goal. Don’t mix generation types (code + docs + tests). Split complex jobs into atomic tasks and sequence them. Scope discipline prevents goal collisions.

- Fewer contradictions; higher first-try success.
- Enables parallelization and caching of steps.
- Cleaner diffs between iterations.

> [!question]- Links
> - Does this collide/agree with an existing atom?
> - Add at least one forward link to a molecule/canonical note.
> - Add one tag-like topic (2–5 terms, not a dump).
