# KERNEL — Easy to verify

Define explicit success criteria inside the prompt (counts, formats, tests). If a human can quickly verify the result, the model can target it; if not, the model will free-associate. Make “verify” part of the spec.

- Converts vague quality into checkable constraints.
- Enables rapid acceptance or immediate revision.
- Supports automated gating in chains.
