# Existence

**Existence** is the status of a physical pattern that **persists under interaction** and **exerts counterfactual causal influence** on other systems over time.

A system exists only insofar as it instantiates [[04-Resources/Atoms/Persistent Distinction\|persistent distinctions]] that survive [[04-Resources/Atoms/Noise\|noise]] and participate in ongoing [[Dynamics\|dynamics]] through constrained interaction. Momentary configurations or isolated patterns do not qualify, even if they are formally definable.

Existence is scale-relative and non-binary. Whether a pattern exists depends on the timescales, constraints, and couplings under which it continues to make a difference to other systems.

Through this role, existence:
- filters ontology to include only causally active, persistent structures,
- grounds entities in interaction rather than description,
- ties “being” directly to physical consequences.

### Distillation

To exist is to continue making a difference.

---
### Why it matters

- **Distinction:** Only persistent distinctions qualify as entities.
- **Persistence:** Existence depends on resistance to noise-driven decay.
- **Time:** Existence requires duration and recordable interaction.
- **RDD coherence:** Prevents treating fleeting fluctuations or abstractions as ontological commitments.

### Conflicts with

- Purely logical or observer-dependent notions of existence.
- Views that treat existence as instantaneous or static.
- Ontologies that admit entities without causal consequences.

## Re-contextualization Log

-  **2025-12-29**
    - **context:** Needed to exclude inert or purely formal patterns from ontology
    - **effect:** refined
    - **note:** Added counterfactual causal influence as a requirement; made existence explicitly scale-relative and interaction-dependent.
        
- **2025-12-26**
    - **context:** Alignment with Persistent Distinction and Time atoms
    - **effect:** clarified
    - **note:** Replaced Boolean existence with a persistence-and-interaction criterion.
