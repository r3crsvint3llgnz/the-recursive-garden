# **Recursion ($R$)**

- **Definition:** The feedback loop where the output of a [[04-Resources/Atoms/RDD – Distinction (Definition)\|distinction]] becomes the input for the next distinction. This drives the system from static state to dynamic process.
    
- **Function:** $R(S_t) \to S_{t+1}$
    
- **Contextual Anchor:** **Cybernetics** (Wiener); **Autopoiesis** (Maturana & Varela).

> [!tip]- Distillation — one idea, in my words
> - Write the irreducible insight. 50–120 words.
> - State the claim/definition in one sentence first.
> - Remove source phrasing; keep mechanism or rule.
> - If you feel the need for “and,” split into another atom.
