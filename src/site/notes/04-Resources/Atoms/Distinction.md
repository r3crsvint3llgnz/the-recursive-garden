# **Distinction**

## Definition

A **distinction** is an **ontic partition of a system’s state space** such that the system’s future evolution depends asymmetrically on which side of the partition it occupies.

A distinction becomes **[[04-Resources/Atoms/Persistent Distinction\|persistent]]** when physical dynamics suppress transitions across the partition over timescales long compared to characteristic fluctuations.

---
## Ontic core

Ontically, a distinction exists when:
- system dynamics differentiate regions of state space with respect to future evolution,
- occupying one region constrains or enables outcomes unavailable from another.

A **persistent distinction** further requires:
- separation into stable or meta-stable regions of state space,
- transition rates across the boundary suppressed relative to thermal or stochastic noise,
- maintenance through dissipation, continuous driving, or loss of microscopic reversibility.

Such partitions exist independently of observation, interpretation, or representation.

---
## Relation to perspective (non-constitutive)

A distinction **may be accessed epistemically** by a system with a [[04-Resources/Atoms/Perspective\|Perspective]], but perspective does not create the distinction.

Perspective determines:
- how an existing distinction is detected or resolved,
- how it is encoded (e.g. as a bit, category, or symbol),
- how it is used for inference, control, or action.

Ontic structure constrains epistemic access; epistemic access does not generate ontic structure.

## Distillation

Differences arise freely through fluctuation.  
A distinction exists when asymmetry constrains future dynamics.  
A distinction becomes real and usable when physical processes make that asymmetry persist against noise.

## Why it matters

- **Foundations of information:** Explains why bits require physical substrates rather than abstract state labels.
- **Thermodynamics:** Grounds memory and structure in metastability, dissipation, and entropy production.
- **Time and recursion:** Clarifies why ordered change and feedback require persistent physical asymmetries.
- **AI and cognition:** Separates representation from the physical conditions that make memory possible.
