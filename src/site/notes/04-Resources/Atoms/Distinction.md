# Distinction

A **distinction** is an **[[04-Resources/Atoms/Ontic\|ontic]], scale-relative partition of a system’s effective [[04-Resources/Atoms/State Space\|state space]]** such that, under identical driving and [[04-Resources/Atoms/Noise\|noise]] conditions, the **statistical distribution of future trajectories depends on which side of the partition the system occupies**.

Equivalently: distinction exists when, under a fixed dynamical evolution and noise model, initial conditions on opposite sides of a partition make different future trajectories physically reachable.

Distinctions arise from [[04-Resources/Atoms/Constraint\|constraints]], barriers, couplings, and energetic costs that differentially shape system [[Dynamics\|dynamics]]. They are defined relative to an effective [[Coarse Graining\|coarse graining]] and may exist at one scale while dissolving at another without becoming [[04-Resources/Atoms/Epistemic\|epistemic]] or observer-dependent.

Through this role, a distinction:

- produces [[Counterfactual Exclusion\|counterfactually]] distinct future ensembles,
- introduces dynamical [[Asymmetry\|asymmetry]] without invoking purpose,
- provides the minimal physical substrate for information, memory, and control.

### Distillation

Differences arise freely through [[Fluctuation\|fluctuation]].  
A distinction exists when differences constrain what can happen next.

---
### Why it matters

- **Constraint:** Distinctions are defined by constraint-mediated partitions of state space.
- **Persistence:** Only distinctions with suppressed transition rates can stabilize into memory.
- **Recursion:** Distinctions are the raw material recursion operates over.
- **RDD coherence:** Establishes asymmetry as the minimal ontic requirement for structure.

- Views that treat distinctions as purely epistemic or representational.
- Accounts that identify information with abstract state labels independent of dynamics.

## Re-contextualization Log

- **2025-12-29**
    - **context:** Needed minimal ontic criterion separating difference from persistence
    - **effect:** refined
    - **note:** Reframed distinction in counterfactual, trajectory-based terms; compressed definition and separated persistence explicitly.
        - The **definition now carries the explanatory load**. - Counterfactual necessity is explicit. - Experimental implications are implicit and unavoidable. - Ontic vs epistemic is enforced by dynamics, not assertion.
- **[[06-Daily/2025-12-24\|2025-12-24]]**
	- **context:** RDD refinement + Landauer reread
	- **effect:** strengthened
	- **note:** Separated distinction from persistence; clarified asymmetry as the minimal ontic criterion.
