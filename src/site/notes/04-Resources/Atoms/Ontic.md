# Ontic

**Ontic** refers to features of physical reality that **operate independently of any observer, model, or representational scheme**.

An ontic claim describes what the world *does*, not how it is described, interpreted, or inferred. Ontic structures determine which states are accessible, which transitions occur, and which patterns persist under interaction and [[04-Resources/Atoms/Noise\|noise]], regardless of whether they are observed or known.

Ontic does not mean complete, final, or certain.  
It means **observer-independent** and **dynamically operative**.

Through this role, ontic structure:
- constrains possible system trajectories in [[04-Resources/Atoms/State Space\|state space]],
- determines which [[04-Resources/Atoms/Distinction\|distinctions]] can physically exist,
- governs persistence, interaction, and causal influence,
- limits which epistemic descriptions can succeed.

### Distillation

Ontic claims are about what the world does, not what we say about it.

---
### Why it matters

- **Epistemic:** Prevents confusing representation with causation.
- **Distinction:** Only ontic partitions can ground real asymmetries.
- **Persistence:** Stability requires ontic mechanisms, not descriptions.
- **RDD coherence:** Keeps the framework anchored to physical dynamics rather than interpretation.

### Conflicts with

- Views that treat physical structure as observer- or model-dependent.
- Interpretations that substitute description, meaning, or belief for mechanism.
- Accounts that collapse ontic and epistemic distinctions.

## Re-contextualization Log

- **2025-12-29**
    - **context:** Needed to distinguish ontic structure from epistemic access across RDD atoms
    - **effect:** strengthened
    - **note:** Reframed ontic as a dynamical constraint on possible trajectories and persistence, not merely observer-independence.
