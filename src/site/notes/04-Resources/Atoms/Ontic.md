An ontic claim is about what the world *does*, not how it is described.  
Ontic structures persist regardless of whether they are measured, known, or interpreted.

Ontic concepts include:
- physical constraints
- dynamical laws
- state-space structure
- irreversible processes

Ontic does **not** mean “certain” or “complete.”  
It means *observer-independent*.
