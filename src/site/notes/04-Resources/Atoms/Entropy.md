# Entropy

**Entropy** is an ontic measure of the number of physically accessible microstates compatible with a system’s macroscopic [[04-Resources/Atoms/Constraint\|constraints]].

In dynamical terms, entropy characterizes the statistical structure of [[04-Resources/Atoms/State Space\|state space]] under a fixed [[Dynamics\|dynamical evolution]]: it describes how many alternative trajectories remain accessible given noise, coupling, and constraint. Entropy does not drive motion or cause change; it constrains what typical evolutions look like.

As constraints relax or [[04-Resources/Atoms/Noise\|noise]] dominates, increasingly many microstates and trajectories become accessible. Under these conditions, [[04-Resources/Atoms/Distinction\|distinctions]] are less likely to persist, and [[04-Resources/Atoms/Record (Memory Substrate)\|records]] become unstable unless additional energetic work is performed.

Maintaining persistent distinctions therefore requires **entropy export** to an environment. Entropy is not reduced in isolation; it is displaced.

Through this role, entropy:
- limits the counterfactual stability of distinctions and records,
- defines the background pressure against which [[04-Resources/Atoms/Persistence (Metastable State Property)\|persistence]] must be achieved,
- constrains which explanations remain valid over time.

### Distillation

Entropy measures how easily a system forgets its past.

---
### Why it matters

- **Distinction:** High entropy destabilizes partitions of state space unless constraints suppress transitions.
- **Persistence:** Metastability exists only relative to entropic pressure and transition rates.
- **Records:** Memory requires continuous work against entropy via constrained coupling and dissipation.
- **RDD coherence:** Prevents treating entropy as disorder, fate, or final state rather than a dynamical constraint on what can last.

- Interpretations of entropy as disorder, decay, or teleological drive.
- Views that treat entropy as a final state rather than a constraint on dynamical explanations.
- Accounts that conflate entropy with energy loss or information destruction in isolation.

## Re-contextualization Log

- **2025-12-29**
    - **context:** Explanatory audit revealed entropy being read as a causal driver or terminal state rather than a dynamical constraint
    - **effect:** refined
    - **note:** Reframed entropy explicitly as a constraint on accessible trajectories under fixed dynamics; clarified its role as pressure against persistence and record stability, not as a force, disorder, or end state.
        
- **2025-12-26**
    - **context:** Alignment with Constraint and Persistent Distinction atoms
    - **effect:** clarified
    - **note:** Removed rigidity and end-state framing; redefined entropy as a dynamical pressure expanding accessible state space and destabilizing distinctions absent compensating constraints.
