# Underlying Potential

## Definition

**Underlying potential** is the **set of physically admissible possibilities** available to a system prior to the imposition of specific constraints or distinctions.

It denotes what *could* occur, not what is realized.

---
## Ontic / Core Claim

Underlying potential is not a substance, field, or superposed object.  
It is a **pre-partition description of state space** before constraints carve accessible regions and dynamics select trajectories.

As constraints, noise, and dynamics act:
- potential is reduced to accessible state space,
- distinctions emerge as partitions,
- persistence and records become possible.

Underlying potential therefore describes **possibility space**, not structure, memory, or information.

---
## Distillation

Potential is what exists before anything is ruled out.

---
## Why it matters

- **Distinction:** Distinctions only make sense relative to unrealized alternatives.
- **Constraint:** Constraints act by eliminating portions of potential.
- **Entropy:** Entropy governs how systems explore remaining potential.
- **RDD coherence:** Prevents treating possibility itself as a physical object.

## Re-contextualization Log

  *effect:* clarified  
  *note:* Removed superposition and infinity language; reframed potential as pre-partition possibility space.
