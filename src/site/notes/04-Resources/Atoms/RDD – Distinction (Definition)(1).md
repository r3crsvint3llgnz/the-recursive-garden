# **Distinction ($\mathcal{D}$)**

- **Definition:** A perspective-indexed carving of [[04-Resources/Atoms/RDD – Potential (Definition)\|potential]].
    
- **Formalism:** $\mathcal{D} = (\Omega, P, C)$, where $\Omega$ is potential, $P$ is perspective, and $C$ is the specific cut/partition.
    
- **Contextual Anchor:** **G. Spencer-Brown’s _Laws of Form_** (The Mark); **Shannon Information** (Resolution of uncertainty).

> [!tip]- Distillation — one idea, in my words
> - Write the irreducible insight. 50–120 words.
> - State the claim/definition in one sentence first.
> - Remove source phrasing; keep mechanism or rule.
> - If you feel the need for “and,” split into another atom.
