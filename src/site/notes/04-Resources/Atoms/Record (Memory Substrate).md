# Record

## Definition

A **record** is a **[[04-Resources/Atoms/Persistent Distinction\|persistent distinction]]** that can be repeatedly accessed and used to condition future dynamics without immediate degradation.

Persistence is necessary but not sufficient; a record must also be readable and causally efficacious.

---
## Ontic / Core Claim

A persistent distinction functions as a record when physical interactions allow its state to be:

- accessed without erasing or destabilizing it,
- reused across multiple interactions,
- coupled selectively to other system dynamics.

This requires controlled interaction channels that preserve the distinction while allowing it to influence future state evolution.

A record is therefore an **ontic structure**, not a semantic object or representation.

---
## Distillation

A record is a distinction that can be consulted without being destroyed.

---
## Why it matters

- **Memory:** Distinguishes mere stability from usable storage.
- **Computation:** Clarifies what physical states can function as memory registers.
- **Recursion:** Enables feedback and state update conditioned on prior outcomes.
- **Time:** Provides the physical substrate required for ordered state change.
