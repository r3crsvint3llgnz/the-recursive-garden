### Constraint

A **constraint** is an [[04-Resources/Atoms/Ontic\|ontic]] restriction that, under a fixed dynamical evolution, renders some states or transitions physically unreachable or energetically suppressed.

Constraints arise from physical structure, boundary conditions, conservation laws, couplings, and energetic costs. By restricting motion through state space, they carve accessible regions from potential and introduce [[Asymmetry\|asymmetries]] in how systems evolve.

Constraints do not choose outcomes or impose purpose.  
They determine which alternatives are physically impossible.

Through this role, constraints:
- enable distinctions by defining meaningful partitions of [[04-Resources/Atoms/State Space\|state space]],
- support [[04-Resources/Atoms/Persistence (Metastable State Property)\|persistence]] by suppressing equilibration,
- make [[04-Resources/Atoms/Record (Memory Substrate)\|records]] possible by controlling access and interaction.

### Distillation

Constraints do not decide what happens.  
They decide what _cannot_ happen.

---
### Why it matters

- **Distinction:** Differences exist only relative to constraints.
- **Persistence:** Metastability requires constrained transitions.
- **Records:** Memory depends on restricted access and controlled coupling.
- **RDD coherence:** Grounds structure and asymmetry without invoking agents or intention.

## Re-contextualization Log

- **2025-12-29**
	- **context:** Dependency audit revealed implicit assumptions about dynamics, reachability, and counterfactual exclusion
	- **effect:** refined
	- **note:** Explicitly tied constraints to fixed dynamical evolution; clarified that constraints operate by rendering states or transitions physically unreachable or energetically suppressed; strengthened links to asymmetry, persistence, and record formation.

- **2025-12-26**
	- **context:** Required mechanism linking state space to distinction and persistence
	- **effect:** created
    - **note:** Introduced constraint as an ontic restriction shaping system dynamics without teleology; grounded distinction and persistence in physical limitations rather than agents or purposes.
