# Epistemic
## Definition

**Epistemic** refers to how a system **represents, accesses, or reasons about ontic structure from a particular perspective**.

How a system represents, accesses, or reasons about features of reality from a particular perspective. Epistemic describes how reality is accessed, not how it is formed.

- Allows perspective and meaning without anthropocentrism
- Makes room for minds, agents, and AI
- Prevents conflating description with causation

Epistemic structures do not create physical reality; they **map onto** ontic structures.

They are:
- system-relative
- capacity-limited
- perspective-dependent

Epistemic concepts include:
- observation
- representation
- belief
- model
- interpretation
