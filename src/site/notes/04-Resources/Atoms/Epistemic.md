# Epistemic

**Epistemic** refers to how a system **accesses, represents, or reasons about ontic structure** given its particular [[04-Resources/Atoms/Perspective\|perspective]] and capacities.

Epistemic structure does not determine what exists or what happens. It determines **which distinctions are accessible, resolvable, or usable** by a system. Different systems may form different epistemic states while interacting with the same underlying [[04-Resources/Atoms/Ontic\|ontic]] reality.

Epistemic limitations arise from finite resolution, incomplete access, noise, and internal modeling constraints. As a result, epistemic states may be partial, approximate, or incorrect without altering the physical structure they describe.

Through this role, the epistemic:
- constrains which [[04-Resources/Atoms/Distinction\|distinctions]] a system can detect or track,
- limits which explanations or models can be constructed,
- enables representation and inference without introducing causal influence on dynamics.

### Distillation

Epistemic describes how reality is accessed, not how it is made.

---
### Why it matters

- **Ontic:** Prevents conflating description with physical structure.
- **Perspective:** Explains why different systems access the same reality differently.
- **AI and cognition:** Allows models, beliefs, and representations without anthropocentrism.
- **RDD coherence:** Enforces a strict boundary between access and causation.

### Conflicts with

- Views that treat observation, belief, or interpretation as causally generative.
- Accounts that collapse epistemic access into ontic structure.
- Anthropocentric theories that reserve epistemic states for human minds.

## Re-contextualization Log

- **2025-12-29**
    - **context:** Required strict separation between access and structure across RDD atoms
    - **effect:** refined
    - **note:** Compressed epistemic definition to a non-causal access role; clarified that epistemic states constrain explanations and models without altering ontic dynamics.
