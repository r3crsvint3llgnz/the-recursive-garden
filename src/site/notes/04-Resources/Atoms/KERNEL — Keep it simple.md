# KERNEL — Keep it simple

> [!tip]- Distillation — one idea, in my words
> - Write the irreducible insight. 50–120 words.
> - State the claim/definition in one sentence first.
> - Remove source phrasing; keep mechanism or rule.
> - If you feel the need for “and,” split into another atom.

A prompt with one clear goal beats long context dumps. State the outcome in a short imperative sentence and omit everything that doesn’t move the model toward that single output. This reduces ambiguity, latency, and token waste while improving focus and accuracy.

- Cuts tokens and time through lower branching.
- Reduces contradictory constraints hidden in long prose.
- Makes success/failure obvious.

> [!question]- Links
> - Does this collide/agree with an existing atom?
> - Add at least one forward link to a molecule/canonical note.

"500 words of context" vs "one clear goal" → faster, cheaper.
