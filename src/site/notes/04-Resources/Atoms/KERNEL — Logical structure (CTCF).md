Use a fixed four-part scaffold: Context (inputs), Task (what to do), Constraints (bounds), Format (output spec). This converts messy intent into a typed contract the model can satisfy.

- Standardizes prompts across a team.
- Makes failures diagnosable (which section broke?).
- Pairs cleanly with programmatic prompting.
