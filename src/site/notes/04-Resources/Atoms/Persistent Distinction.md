# Persistent Distinction

## Definition

A **persistent distinction** is an ontic partition of a system’s state space whose lifetime against noise exceeds the timescale of the dynamics it constrains.

Persistence is defined operationally by suppressed transition rates between regions of state space, not by representation or use.

---
## Ontic / Core Claim

A distinction persists when physical dynamics prevent rapid equilibration across its boundary.

This requires that:
- transitions between regions of state space are suppressed relative to thermal or stochastic fluctuations,
- the suppression is maintained through metastability, dissipation, or continuous driving,
- the distinction’s lifetime is long compared to the characteristic timescale of system evolution or control.

Persistence is therefore a physical property of the system’s dynamics and environment, not an epistemic property of an observer.

## Distillation

A distinction persists when physics makes it hard to forget.

---
## Why it matters

- **Memory and records:** Explains what it takes for a distinction to function as memory rather than transient fluctuation.
- **Thermodynamics:** Grounds stability and durability in metastability, noise suppression, and entropy production.
- **Control and computation:** Clarifies why reliable state variables require energetic or dynamical cost.
