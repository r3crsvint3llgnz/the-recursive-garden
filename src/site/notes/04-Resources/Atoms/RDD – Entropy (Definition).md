# **Entropy ($H_{RDD}$)**

- **Definition:** The decoherence of [[04-Resources/Atoms/RDD – Potential (Definition)\|potential]]. It is not just energy loss, but **Rigidity**. High entropy means the system has made so many rigid [[04-Resources/Atoms/Distinction (Persistent State-Space Partition)\|distinctions]] that it has lost access to the superposition field (Potential).
    
- **Contextual Anchor:** **Thermodynamic Entropy** vs. **Logical Depth**.

> [!tip]- Distillation — one idea, in my words
> - Write the irreducible insight. 50–120 words.
> - State the claim/definition in one sentence first.
> - Remove source phrasing; keep mechanism or rule.
> - If you feel the need for “and,” split into another atom.
