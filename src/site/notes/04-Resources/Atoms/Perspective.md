# Perspective

## Definition

A **perspective** is a **stabilized reference structure** that determines which distinctions are accessible, resolvable, or actionable within a system.

A perspective does not create distinctions; it constrains how existing distinctions are detected, encoded, and used.

---
## Ontic / Core Claim

A perspective is not an observer or a subject, but a **structural constraint** imposed by a system’s internal organization, boundary conditions, and interaction channels.

Given the same ontic distinctions:
- different perspectives resolve different partitions of state space,
- different subsets of distinctions become salient or usable,
- different records become accessible or meaningful.

Perspective therefore mediates **epistemic access** to ontic structure without constituting that structure.

## Distillation

A perspective is the set of constraints that determines *which differences can make a difference* for a system.

---
## Why it matters

- **Measurement and inference:** Explains why the same physical reality yields different observable outcomes across systems.
- **Information theory:** Separates physical distinctions from the frames that access them.
- **Cognition:** Grounds perception and belief in structural constraints rather than intrinsic meaning.
- **RDD coherence:** Prevents collapse of epistemic access into ontic creation.

## Re-contextualization Log

- **2025-12-26** · *context:* Alignment with Distinction / Record stack  
  *effect:* clarified  
  *note:* Removed “knower” framing; redefined perspective as a non-constitutive access constraint on ontic distinctions.
