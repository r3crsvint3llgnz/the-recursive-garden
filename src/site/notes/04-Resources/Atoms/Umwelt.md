# Umwelt

## Definition

**Umwelt** is the **system-specific subset of distinctions** in the physical world that are accessible and actionable given a system’s sensory, motor, and internal constraints.

Different systems inhabit different Umwelten while remaining embedded in the same underlying reality.

---
## Ontic / Core Claim

Umwelt does not describe what exists, but **what can be accessed**.

Given the same ontic distinctions:
- different organisms resolve different signals,
- different action possibilities become available,
- different records become usable.

Umwelt therefore characterizes **epistemic access shaped by embodiment and organization**, not ontic structure itself.

---
## Distillation

An Umwelt is the slice of reality a system can touch.

---
## Why it matters

- **Biology:** Explains species-specific perception without invoking subjectivism.
- **Cognition:** Grounds experience in constraint-limited access to distinctions.
- **RDD coherence:** Provides a biological analogue of Perspective without making it constitutive.
- **AI:** Clarifies that different sensorimotor stacks imply different accessible distinctions.

## Re-contextualization Log

- **2025-12-26** · *context:* Split from Perspective atom  
  *effect:* created  
  *note:* Isolated Umwelt as a biological concept describing constrained epistemic access rather than ontic structure.
