# Persistence

**Persistence** is the **ontic property of a system occupying a region of effective [[04-Resources/Atoms/State Space\|state space]] such that transitions out of that region are statistically suppressed over time** relative to characteristic [[04-Resources/Atoms/Noise\|noise]].

A state is persistent when, under fixed driving and noise statistics, its expected dwell time exceeds the timescale of typical fluctuations. Persistence is a property of system dynamics, not of observation or description.

Persistence does not require permanence. It requires **[[Metastability\|metastability]]**.

Through this role, persistence:
- stabilizes distinctions against noise-driven decay,
- enables accumulation of causal history,
- makes records and memory physically possible.

---
### Ontic core

Ontically, persistence exists when:

- system dynamics include **constraints, barriers, or restoring structures** that confine trajectories,
- escape from the region requires energetically costly or coordinated fluctuations,
- dissipation and loss of microscopic reversibility suppress return paths,
- transition rates are low relative to environmental noise timescales.

Persistence is therefore a dynamical property measurable via escape rates, lifetimes, and response statistics.

---
### Relation to distinction

Persistence is a **necessary condition** for [[04-Resources/Atoms/Distinction\|distinction]].

Transient differences may occur freely through fluctuation.  
A distinction exists only when a difference **persists long enough to condition future dynamics**.

Without persistence, differences do not accumulate.  
With persistence, system history becomes causally relevant.

---
### Relation to time

Persistence introduces an **asymmetry between past and future**:

- the present state encodes information about prior states,
- future evolution depends on that encoded trace.

[[04-Resources/Atoms/Time\|Time]] does not cause persistence.  
Persistence makes time observable.

---
### Distillation

What does not persist cannot inform the future.

---
### Why it matters

- **Memory:** Records require persistent physical substrates.
- **Entropy:** Entropic pressure erodes persistence unless countered by constraints and dissipation.
- **Information:** Bits exist only where persistence suppresses noise-driven transitions.
- **RDD coherence:** Separates transient fluctuation from historically meaningful change.

- Views that treat stability as instantaneous or purely descriptive.
- Accounts that conflate persistence with permanence.
- Interpretations that assume memory without physical suppression of noise.

## Re-contextualization Log

- **2025-12-29**
    - **context:** Overlap between persistence, time, and distinction reduced explanatory clarity
    - **effect:** refined
    - **note:** Reframed persistence strictly as metastable suppression of transitions; separated its role from time and memory while preserving dependency relations.
        
- **2025-12-26**    
    - **context:** Alignment with Distinction and Entropy atoms
    - **effect:** clarified
    - **note:** Explicitly defined persistence via dwell times and escape rates rather than qualitative stability.
