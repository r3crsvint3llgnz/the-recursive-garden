# **Persistence**

## Definition

**Persistence** is the **ontic property of a system state remaining stable or metastable over time**, such that departures from that state are statistically suppressed relative to characteristic fluctuations.

---

## Ontic core (what exists physically)

Ontically, persistence exists when:

- a system occupies a region of state space with a **restoring structure** (e.g. basin, barrier, constraint),
- transitions out of that region require energy or coordinated fluctuations,
- the expected dwell time exceeds the system’s natural noise timescale,
- stability is maintained through **irreversible dissipation** and loss of microscopic reversibility.

Persistence is a property of system dynamics, not of observation.

---

## Relation to distinction

Persistence is a **necessary condition** for distinction.

- Without persistence, differences fluctuate but do not accumulate.
- With persistence, a state conditions future system behavior.

A [[04-Resources/Atoms/Distinction (Persistent State-Space Partition)\|Distinction]] exists only when a difference persists.

---

## Relation to time

Persistence creates an **asymmetry between past and future**:

- the system’s present state encodes a trace of its past,
- future evolution depends on that trace.

Time does not cause persistence; persistence makes time observable.

What does not persist cannot inform the future. Persistence is the physical precondition for memory, time, and information.

- Grounds memory and information in physical dynamics.
- Explains why entropy increase corresponds to loss of reversibility, not motion.
- Separates transient fluctuation from historically meaningful change.
- Enables experimental thresholds for when a bit exists.
