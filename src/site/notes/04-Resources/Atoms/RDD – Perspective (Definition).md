# **Perspective ($P$)**

- **Definition:** A stabilized locus of [[04-Resources/Atoms/Distinction (Persistent State-Space Partition)\|distinctions]]. It is the "Knower" in the system. $P$ is not necessarily biological consciousness; it is any structural identity that provides a reference frame for a cut.
    
- **Formalism:** $P$ is the constraint that necessitates _where_ a distinction is made.
    
- **Contextual Anchor:** **QBism (Quantum Bayesianism)** agent; **Von Uexküll’s _Umwelt_**.

> [!tip]- Distillation — one idea, in my words
> - Write the irreducible insight. 50–120 words.
> - State the claim/definition in one sentence first.
> - Remove source phrasing; keep mechanism or rule.
> - If you feel the need for “and,” split into another atom.
