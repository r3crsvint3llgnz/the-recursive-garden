# KERNEL — Explicit constraints

> [!tip]- Distillation — one idea, in my words
> - Write the irreducible insight. 50–120 words.
> - State the claim/definition in one sentence first.

State what the model must not do and the hard bounds it must respect. Negative directives and caps (libraries, line limits, runtime, style bans) prune the search space and suppress unwanted behavior.

- Reduces hallucinated extras.
- Improves determinism and safety.
- Lowers edit cost by preventing overreach.

> [!question]- Links
> - Does this collide/agree with an existing atom?
> - Add at least one forward link to a molecule/canonical note.
> - Add one tag-like topic (2–5 terms, not a dump).
