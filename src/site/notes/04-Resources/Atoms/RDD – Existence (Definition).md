# **Existence ($E$)**

- **Definition:** The state of a stabilized [[04-Resources/Atoms/RDD – Distinction (Definition)\|distinction]] currently undergoing recursive update through interaction.
    
- **Boolean Logic:** IF $R > 0$ THEN $E = 1$ ELSE $E = 0$.

> [!tip]- Distillation — one idea, in my words
> - Write the irreducible insight. 50–120 words.
> - State the claim/definition in one sentence first.
> - Remove source phrasing; keep mechanism or rule.
> - If you feel the need for “and,” split into another atom.
