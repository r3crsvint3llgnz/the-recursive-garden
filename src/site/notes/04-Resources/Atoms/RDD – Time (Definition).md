# **Time ($t$)**

- **Definition:** The index of [[04-Resources/Atoms/RDD – Recursion (Definition)\|recursion]]. Time is discrete and local to a [[04-Resources/Atoms/Perspective\|perspective]]. It is not a container dimensions; it is a sequence of updates.
    
- **Formalism:** $t = R_i$ (The $i$-th iteration of the loop).
    
- **Contextual Anchor:** **Loop Quantum Gravity** (Rovelli); **Julian Barbour’s _The End of Time_** (Time as change-state).

> [!tip]- Distillation — one idea, in my words
> - Write the irreducible insight. 50–120 words.
> - State the claim/definition in one sentence first.
> - Remove source phrasing; keep mechanism or rule.
> - If you feel the need for “and,” split into another atom.
