# Persistence Bias

**Persistence bias** is the **statistical asymmetry in transition probabilities** by which a system, under fixed [[Dynamics\|dynamics]], [[04-Resources/Atoms/Constraint\|constraints]], and [[04-Resources/Atoms/Noise\|noise]] statistics, is more likely to remain within or return to previously occupied regions of effective [[04-Resources/Atoms/State Space\|state space]] than to transition into radically reconfigured regions.

It is not a force. It is an emergent bias in the stochastic flow of trajectories produced by barriers, constrained reachability, and the combinatorial difficulty of dismantling [[04-Resources/Atoms/Persistent Distinction\|persistent distinctions]].

Persistence bias is scale-relative: what counts as “the same region” depends on [[Coarse Graining\|coarse graining]] and the effective description used.

Through this role, persistence bias:
- increases dwell times and recurrence in metastable basins,
- makes large-scale reconfiguration exponentially unlikely relative to local fluctuations,
- enables cumulative structure by favoring continuity over wholesale rearrangement.

### Distillation

What already exists is easier to keep than to rebuild.

---
### Why it matters

- **Persistence:** Explains why metastable structures dominate observed histories via suppressed escape rates.
- **Entropy:** Specifies why entropic exploration produces mostly local variation rather than constant global rearrangement.
- **Existence:** Separates causally active patterns from fleeting fluctuations by recurrence and durability.
- **RDD coherence:** Provides a non-teleological account of “stickiness” without redefining gravity or invoking agency.

### Conflicts with

- Teleological “selection” principles that treat persistence as purpose-driven rather than rate-driven.
- Reframing “gravity” as a general persistence concept (category error: physical gravity remains spacetime curvature and interaction, not a statistical bias).
- Accounts that treat persistence bias as epistemic preference rather than ontic transition asymmetry.

## Re-contextualization Log

- **2025-12-29**
    - **context:** Needed operational definition to prevent persistence bias from sounding like a new force
    - **effect:** refined
    - **note:** Redefined persistence bias as an asymmetry in transition probabilities over effective state space; made scale-relativity and measurement hooks (dwell times, recurrence, escape rates) explicit.

- **2025-12-26**
    - **context:** Separation of dynamical bias from gravitational interaction
    - **effect:** renamed
    - **note:** Reframed prior “gravity” language into persistence bias to avoid category error and restore physical specificity.
