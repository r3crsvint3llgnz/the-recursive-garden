# Time

## Definition

**Time** is the **ordering of state changes in a physical system**, defined by irreversible dynamics and the persistence of records.

Time is not a container or background dimension; it is an emergent ordering that exists only where change leaves durable traces.

---
## Ontic / Core Claim

Time exists when physical processes produce **asymmetric, irreversible transitions** that distinguish earlier from later states.

This requires:
- non-equilibrium dynamics,
- noise-driven exploration of state space,
- constraints that allow some distinctions to persist as records.

Without persistent records, state changes cannot be ordered, and time has no physical meaning beyond parameterization.

Time is therefore **global in origin but local in realization**, depending on which records are accessible within a given system.

---
## Distillation

Time is what exists when change can be remembered.

---
## Why it matters

- **Entropy:** The arrow of time follows from irreversible exploration of state space.
- **Records:** Memory is the substrate that makes before and after meaningful.
- **Recursion:** Iteration requires ordered state updates grounded in persistence.
- **RDD coherence:** Prevents treating time as fundamental while preserving its necessity.
